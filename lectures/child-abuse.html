                                <p>The term "battered child syndrome" was coined to characterize the clinical manifestations of serious physical abuse in young children. This term is generally applied to children showing repeated and devastating injury to the skin, skeletal system, or nervous system. It includes children with multiple fractures of different ages, head trauma, and severe visceral trauma, with evidence of repeated infliction.</p>
                                
                                <p>Another form is the "The shaken infant". Shaking is a prevalent form of abuse seen in very young children (less than 1 year). Most perpetrators of such abuse are males. Intracranial hemorrhages, retinal hemorrhages, and chip fractures of the child's extremities can result from very rapid shaking of an infant.</p>

                                <p>Corporal punishment of children in the form of hitting, punching, kicking, or beating - is socially and legally accepted in most countries. In many, it is a significant phenomenon in schools and other institutions, and in penal systems for young offenders.</p>
                                

                                <h4>SEXUAL ABUSE</h4>

                                <p>Involves forcing or enticing a child to take part in sexual activities including prostitution, whether or not the child is aware of what is happening.</p>
                                
                                <p>May involve physical contact, including penetrative (e.g., rape) sex.</p>

                                <p>Although child abuse occurs in Nigeria, it has received little attention.</p>
                                
                                <p>Probably due to emphasis placed on more prevalent childhood problems of malnutrition & infection. General assumption that extended family provides love, care & protection to all children.</p>
                                
                                <p>Poverty has made more children live &/or work on the street & has increased their vulnerability to trafficking. Also, some traditional child rearing practices adversely affect some children.</p>
                                
                                <p>Various other types of child abuse have been identified particularly in urban areas.</p>
                                
                                <p>Abandonment of normal infants by unmarried or very poor mothers, increase child labor & exploitation of children from rural areas to urban elite families & abuse of children in urban nuclear families by child minders.</p>

                                <h4>Almajiri Syndrome</h4>

                                <p>Has remained worrisome in the minds of Northern elites because it's a form of embarrassment to the region.</p>
                                
                                <p>They are children who, irrespective of gender, beg for assistance on the street or from house to house.</p>
                                
                                <p>Children between the ages of <strong>7</strong> and <strong>20</strong> who attend informal religious schools but equally roam about with the purpose of getting assistance or engaging in some form of labor to earn a living.</p>
                                
                                <p>Another form of child abuse in the sense that they are exposed to laborious work at a tender age.</p>
                                
                                <p>Child labor is a fundamental factor of child abuse.</p>
                                
                                <p>Also being denied their right to Western education.</p>
                                
                                <p>Once the basic needs of a child are provided, there is no doubt that they can perform wonderfully in their undertakings and can deliver as leaders of tomorrow.</p>

                                <h4>Recommendations</h4>

                                <ul>
                                  <li>Provision of infrastructural facilities & employment opportunities in rural areas to prevent the drift of young population to cities.</li>
                                  <li>Effective legal protection for the handicapped child.</li>
                                  <li>Create greater awareness of the existence of child abuse in the community by health & social workers through education.</li>
                                  <li>Adoption and signing into law of the Child Right Act of 2003 by all states of the federation.</li>
                                  <li>Government should make primary education free for all children.</li>
                                </ul>
                                
                                <h4>Conclusion</h4>

                                <p>Child abuse is a common problem in our society. Children injured through abuse are at significant risk for future psychiatric disorders.</p>
                                
                                <p>Health care providers of all types must be alert to the indicators of abuse and must be willing to report their suspicions to the appropriate child protective agencies.</p>
                                
                                <p>Only in this manner can we protect our children and facilitate their development into capable young adults who will become competent, caring parents.</p>
