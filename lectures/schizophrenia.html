            <a aria-hidden='true' href='#header-1'>Introduction</a>

        </header>
        <div class='body'>
            <ul>
                <li>The term schizophrenia was coined in 1908 by the Swiss psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler.</li>
                <li>Derived from the Greek <em>skhizo</em> (split) and <em>phren</em> (mind).</li>
                <li>Various definitions of the disorder have evolved, and numerous treatment strategies have been proposed, but none have proved to be uniformly effective or sufficient.</li>
                <li>Of all the mental illnesses, schizophrenia probably is responsible for:</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Lengthier hospitalizations,</li>
                    <li>Greater chaos in family life,</li>
                    <li>More exorbitant costs to individuals and governments, and</li>
                    <li>More fears than any other.</li>
                </ol>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>History</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Emil Kraepelin:</strong> This illness develops relatively early in life, and its course is likely deteriorating and chronic. Deterioration reminded dementia ("<em>Dementia praecox</em>"), but was not followed by any organic changes of the brain, detectable at that time.</li>
                <li><strong>Eugen Bleuler (1911):</strong> He renamed Kraepelin‚Äôs dementia praecox as schizophrenia; he recognized the cognitive impairment in this illness, which he named as a "splitting" of the mind.</li>
                <li><strong>Kurt Schneider (1959):</strong> He emphasized the role of psychotic symptoms, such as hallucinations and delusions, and gave them the privilege of "the first-rank symptoms" even in the concept of the diagnosis of schizophrenia.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Definition</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Schizophrenia is defined by:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>A group of characteristic positive and negative symptoms</li>
                    <li>Deterioration in social, occupational, or interpersonal relationships</li>
                    <li>Continuous signs of the disturbance for at least 6 months</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Schizophrenia is a psychotic condition characterized by a disturbance in thinking, emotions, volitions, and faculties in the presence of clear consciousness, which usually leads to social withdrawal.</li>
                <li>The schizophrenic disorders are characterized in general by fundamental and characteristic distortions of thinking and perception, and affects that are inappropriate or blunted.</li>
                <li>Clear consciousness and intellectual capacity are usually maintained although certain cognitive deficits may evolve in the course of time.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>The most important psychopathological phenomena include:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Thought echo</li>
                    <li>Thought insertion or withdrawal</li>
                    <li>Thought broadcasting</li>
                    <li>Delusional perception and delusions of control</li>
                    <li>Influence or passivity</li>
                    <li>Hallucinatory voices commenting or discussing the patient in the third person</li>
                    <li>Thought disorders and negative symptoms</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            
            
            <h4>4 As of Bleuler</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Bleuler maintained that, for the diagnosis of schizophrenia, the following four fundamental symptoms are most important:</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Affective blunting</li>
                    <li>Loosening of association (fragmented thinking)</li>
                    <li>Autism</li>
                    <li>Ambivalence (fragmented emotional response)</li>
                </ol>
                <li>These groups of symptoms are called the "four A's," and Bleuler thought that they are "primary" for this diagnosis.</li>
            </ul>
            

            <h4>Schneider‚Äôs First-Rank Symptoms</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The presence of one or more of these is considered to be strongly suggestive of schizophrenia:</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Hearing one‚Äôs thoughts spoken aloud (thought echo).</li>
                    <li>Hallucinatory voices in the form of statement and reply (the patient hears voices discussing him in the third person).</li>
                    <li>Hallucinatory voices in the form of a running commentary (voices commenting on one‚Äôs action).</li>
                    <li>Thought withdrawal (thoughts cease, and the subject experiences them as removed by an external force).</li>
                    <li>Thought insertion.</li>
                    <li>Thought broadcasting.</li>
                    <li>Delusional perception.</li>
                    <li>Somatic passivity.</li>
                    <li>Made volition or acts.</li>
                    <li>Made impulses.</li>
                    <li>Made feelings or affect.</li>
                </ol>
            </ul>

            <h4>2nd Rank Symptoms</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Perplexity (bewilder, puzzle, or disconcert)</li>
                <li>Emotional blunting</li>
                <li>Other hallucinations and delusions</li>
            </ul>

        <div class='body'>
            <ul>
                <li>Characteristically, disturbances in thought processes, perception, and affect invariably result in severe deterioration of social and occupational functioning.</li>
                <li>Symptoms generally appear in late adolescence or early adulthood.</li>
                <li>The pattern of development can be viewed in four phases:</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>The pre-morbid phase,</li>
                    <li>The prodromal phase,</li>
                    <li>The active psychotic phase (schizophrenia), and</li>
                    <li>The residual phase.</li>
                </ol>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>The Pre-morbid Phase</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The pre-morbid personality often indicates social maladjustment, social withdrawal, irritability, and antagonistic thoughts and behavior.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Very shy and withdrawn, poor peer relationships, doing poorly in school, and demonstrating antisocial behavior.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>The Prodromal Phase</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The prodromal phase of schizophrenia begins with a change from pre-morbid functioning and extends until the onset of frank psychotic symptoms.</li>
                <li>It has an average length of 2 and 5 years.</li>
                <li>The person experiences substantial functional impairment and nonspecific symptoms such as:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sleep disturbance</li>
                    <li>Anxiety</li>
                    <li>Irritability</li>
                    <li>Depressed mood</li>
                    <li>Poor concentration</li>
                    <li>Fatigue</li>
                    <li>Behavioral deficits such as deterioration in role functioning and social withdrawal.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>The Active Phase</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>In the active phase of the disorder, psychotic symptoms are prominent with characteristics such as:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Delusions</li>
                    <li>Hallucinations</li>
                    <li>Disorganized speech</li>
                    <li>Catatonic behavior</li>
                    <li>Negative symptoms</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Social/occupational dysfunction:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Persists for a period not less than 6 months</li>
                    <li>Schizoaffective and mood disorder exclusion has been ruled out</li>
                    <li>Substance/general medical condition has been excluded</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>The Residual Phase</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>During the residual phase, symptoms of the acute stage are either absent or no longer prominent.</li>
                <li>Negative symptoms may remain, and flat affect and impairment in role functioning are common.</li>
            </ul>

                <li>The symptoms of schizophrenia fall into three broad categories.</li>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Positive Symptoms:</strong> Unusual thoughts or perceptions, including hallucinations, delusions, thought disorder, and disorder of movement.</li>
                    <li><strong>Negative Symptoms:</strong> Reductions in normal emotional and behavioral states such as:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Anhedonia:</strong> Inability to feel pleasure; lack of interest or enjoyment in activities or relationships</li>
                        <li><strong>Alogia:</strong> Lack of meaningful speech, which may take several forms, including poverty of speech (reduced amount of speech) or poverty of content of speech (little information is conveyed; vague, repetitive)</li>
                        <li><strong>Asociality:</strong> Impairments in social relationships; few friends, poor social skills, little interest in being with other people</li>
                        <li><strong>Flat Affect:</strong> No stimulus can elicit an emotional response.</li>
                        <li><strong>Avolition:</strong> Inability or lack of energy to engage in routine activities.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li><strong>Cognitive Symptoms:</strong> Subtle and often detected only when neuropsychological tests are performed.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Poor executive functioning</li>
                        <li>Inability to sustain attention</li>
                        <li>Problems with working memory</li>
                    </ul>
                </ol>
                <li><strong>Others:</strong> Ambivalence, association looseness, flight of ideas, echopraxia, echolalia, perseveration, catatonia, verbigeration, neologism, mannerism, etc.</li>
                <p>While positive symptoms reflect an excess or distortion of normal function, negative symptoms refer to a diminution or absence of normal behaviors related to motivation and interest.</p>

            <p><strong>A. Characteristics of Symptoms:</strong> Two or more of the following, each present for a significant portion of time during a 1-month period (or less if successfully treated). At least one of these must be (1), (2), or (3):</p>
            <ol>
                <li> Delusions.</li>
                <li> Hallucinations.</li>

                <li> Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior.</li>
                <li> Negative symptoms (i.e., diminished emotional expression/avolition).</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p><strong>B. Social/Occupational Dysfunction:</strong> For a significant portion of the time since onset of the disturbance, the level of functioning in one or more major areas, such as work, interpersonal relations, or self-care, is markedly below the level achieved prior to onset (or when the onset is in childhood or adolescence, there is failure to achieve the expected level of interpersonal, academic, or occupational functioning).</p>
            
            <p><strong>C. Duration:</strong> Continuous signs of the disturbance persist for at least 6 months that must include at least 1 month of symptoms meeting criterion A.</p>

                <li>Presentation is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., drug of abuse, medication) or other medical condition.</li>
                <li>If there is a history of ASD or a communication disorder of childhood onset, the additional diagnosis of schizophrenia is made only if prominent delusions or hallucinations, in addition to the other required symptoms of schizophrenia, are also present for at least 1 month (or less if successfully treated).</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>ICD-11 Diagnostic Requirements</h4>
            <p>
                Schizophrenia or Other Primary Psychotic Disorders is a grouping of disorders characterized by significant impairments in reality testing and alterations in behavior. Manifested by symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, formal thought disorder (disorganized speech), and disorganized behavior. May be accompanied by psychomotor disturbances and negative symptoms like blunted or flat affect.
            </p>
            
            <h4><em>Exclusion Criteria:</em></h4>
            <p>
                Symptoms should not occur primarily due to substance use (e.g., Hallucinogen Intoxication) or another medical condition not classified under Mental, Behavioral, or Neurodevelopmental Disorders (e.g., Huntington Disease).
            </p>
            
            <h4><em>Primary Psychotic Disorders:</em></h4>
            <p>
                The disorders in this grouping are referred to as primary psychotic disorders because psychotic symptoms are their defining feature. Psychotic symptoms may also occur in the context of other mental disorders (e.g., Mood Disorders or Dementia). In these cases, symptoms occur alongside other characteristic features of those disorders. Experiences of reality loss/distortion occur on a continuum throughout the population. Disorders in this group represent patterns of symptoms and behaviors occurring with sufficient frequency and intensity to deviate from expected cultural or subcultural expectations.
            </p>

                Schizophrenia with childhood onset is conceptually the same as schizophrenia in adolescence or adulthood. Although rare, schizophrenia in prepubertal children includes the presence of at least two of the following: hallucinations, delusions, grossly disorganized speech or behavior, social withdrawal for at least 1 month. Social or academic dysfunction must be present, and continuous signs of disturbance must persist for at least 6 months.
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Between 5-6 years of age.</li>
                <li>Visual hallucination commoner.</li>
                <li>Hallucinations and delusions are less elaborate.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Epidemiology:</h4>

            <p>
                Before the 1960s, the term childhood psychosis was applied to a heterogeneous group of pervasive developmental disorders without hallucinations and delusions.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In the 1980s, schizophrenia with childhood onset was formally separated from autistic disorder. A subgroup of autistic children will eventually have schizophrenia.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Schizophrenia in prepubertal children is much more rare than in adolescence and young adulthood.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <strong>Boys : Girls Ratio:</strong> 1.67 : 1. Boys are often more symptomatic at a younger age than girls. Symptoms are usually insidious, and the prevalence rate in their parents is about 8%.

            <p>
                Schizophrenia usually begins in late adolescence or young adulthood and persists throughout life. Although first episode diagnoses after age 65 are rare, a late-onset type beginning after age 45 has been described. Women are more likely to have a late onset than men. Another difference between late-onset and early-onset is the greater prevalence of paranoid schizophrenia in the late-onset type.

        <p>
            A thorough medical history, including a systematic review and thorough physical examination, is important in the assessment of all patients presenting with psychotic symptoms. It is all too easy to focus on the psychiatric aspects of the assessment to the exclusion of medical aspects, which may inform the diagnosis and aid treatment planning.
        </p>

                    <p>
                        The history of presenting complaints is very important, as is the treatment received so far. 
                    </p>

                    <h4>IMPORTANT PARTS OF THE HISTORY </h4>
                    <h4>Demographic Information:</h4>
                    <p>
                        Begin by gathering basic demographic information such as age, gender, occupation, and marital status. Additionally, inquire about the patient's living situation and support network, as these factors can significantly impact the course and management of schizophrenia.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4>Presenting Complaint:</h4>
                    <p>
                        Explore the patient's chief complaint and the reason for seeking medical attention. Pay careful attention to the onset, duration, and progression of symptoms. Common presenting symptoms of schizophrenia include hallucinations, delusions, disorganized thinking, and impaired social functioning.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4>Psychiatric History:</h4>
                    <p>
                        Inquire about the patient's psychiatric history, including any previous diagnoses, treatments, and hospitalizations. Ask about the age of onset of symptoms and any family history of psychiatric disorders, as there may be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4>Substance Use:</h4>
                    <p>
                        Substance use can exacerbate or mimic symptoms of schizophrenia. Obtain a detailed history of alcohol, tobacco, and drug use, including frequency, duration, and type of substances. Substance-induced psychosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4>Medical History:</h4>
                    <p>
                        Certain medical conditions and medications may contribute to or exacerbate psychotic symptoms. Obtain a comprehensive medical history, including any chronic illnesses, medications, and recent changes in health. Pay particular attention to conditions that affect the central nervous system.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4>Developmental and Educational History:</h4>
                    <p>
                        Explore the patient's developmental milestones, educational history, and any history of academic or social difficulties. Assessing cognitive functioning and educational achievements can provide insights into the impact of schizophrenia on daily functioning.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4>Social and Occupational History:</h4>
                    <p>
                        Understanding the patient's social and occupational functioning is crucial. Inquire about relationships, social support, and any recent life stressors. Assess current and past occupational functioning, as schizophrenia often impairs the ability to maintain employment.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4>Forensic History:</h4>
                    <p>
                        Explore any legal history, including involvement with law enforcement, arrests, or legal consequences related to the patient's symptoms. Legal issues may arise due to the behaviors associated with schizophrenia.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4>Cultural Considerations:</h4>
                    <p>
                        Be sensitive to cultural factors that may influence the expression and interpretation of symptoms. Cultural beliefs and practices can impact the patient's experience of schizophrenia and their willingness to seek and adhere to treatment.
                    </p>
                    
                    
                    <h4>Key Features in Systematic Review:</h4>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Neurological:</strong> Headache, head injury, abnormal movements of the mouth or tongue, diplopia, hearing or visual impairment (delusional disorder is more common when there is sensory impairment), fits/faints/blackouts/dizzy spells, altered consciousness or memory problems, stroke, coordination problems, marked tremor, or muscle stiffness.</li>
                        <li><strong>Respiratory:</strong> Dyspnoea, orthopnoea.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cardiovascular:</strong> Chest pain, palpitations.</li>
                        <li><strong>GI:</strong> Constipation (can be a side effect of anticholinergic psychotropic drugs), nausea, vomiting.</li>
                        <li><strong>Genitourinary:</strong> Urinary hesitancy (retention related to anticholinergic drugs); in women, a menstrual history; for both: sexual problems (which may be secondary to medication).</li>

                    <h4>IMPORTANT THINGS TO NOTE FOR MENTAL STATE EXAMINATION</h4>
                    <h4>Appearance:</h4>
                    <p>
                        In the assessment of patients with schizophrenia, careful attention to appearance is essential. Note any abnormalities in grooming, hygiene, or dress that may indicate the patient's disorganization or impairment in self-care. Additionally, observe for peculiarities in motor behavior or posturing that may be indicative of psychomotor abnormalities associated with schizophrenia.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4>Behavior:</h4>
                    <p>
                        Evaluate the patient's behavior for signs of agitation, restlessness, or psychomotor retardation. Patients with schizophrenia may exhibit stereotypic movements, peculiar mannerisms, or catatonic behaviors. Documenting the presence and nature of these behaviors aids in the formulation of a comprehensive clinical picture.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4>Speech:</h4>
                    <p>
                        Analyze the patient's speech for rate, volume, and coherence. Schizophrenia may manifest with disorganized or incoherent speech, including derailment, tangentiality, or thought blocking. Additionally, assess for the presence of auditory hallucinations, a common symptom in schizophrenia, which may be reflected in the patient's speech content.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4>Thought Process:</h4>
                    <p>
                        Examine the structure and organization of thought. Patients with schizophrenia often exhibit disorganized thought processes, characterized by loose associations or tangential thinking. Formal thought disorders, such as poverty of thought or thought blocking, should be systematically assessed.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4>Thought Content:</h4>
                    <p>
                        Interrogate the patient's thought content for the presence of delusions, which are often a hallmark of schizophrenia. Delusions can take various forms, including paranoid, grandiose, or bizarre themes. Document the nature, intensity, and conviction associated with these delusional beliefs.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4>Perception:</h4>
                    <p>
                        Assess perceptual abnormalities, particularly hallucinations. Patients with schizophrenia may experience auditory, visual, or tactile hallucinations. Probe for the content, frequency, and emotional impact of these hallucinatory experiences to gain insights into the patient's subjective reality.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4>Mood and Affect:</h4>
                    <p>
                        Evaluate the patient's mood and affect, differentiating between the emotional experience and its outward expression. Schizophrenia may present with a blunted or incongruent affect, and mood disturbances such as depression or anxiety may coexist. Note any fluctuations in mood and affect over the course of the examination.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4>Cognitive Functioning:</h4>
                    <p>
                        Assess cognitive domains, including attention, memory, and executive function. Cognitive impairment is often observed in schizophrenia, affecting the individual's ability to perform daily activities. Utilize standardized cognitive screening tools to quantify cognitive deficits accurately.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4>Insight and Judgment:</h4>
                    <p>
                        Evaluate the patient's insight into their condition and level of judgment. Lack of insight is common in schizophrenia, and impaired judgment may manifest in risky or inappropriate behaviors. Understanding these aspects is crucial for treatment planning and assessing the patient's capacity for self-care.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4>Making a Diagnosis</h4>
                    <p>
                        Even in the absence of a specific cause, the etiology of schizophrenia is predominantly influenced by factors affecting the brain. However, the following areas might be considered as a guide to the assessment of predisposing, precipitating, and perpetuating factors:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Biological:</strong> Consider family history of psychiatric illness, recent substance misuse, drug non-compliance, history of obstetric complications, brain injury, and comorbid medical illness.</li>
                        <li><strong>Psychosocial:</strong> Consider recent stressful life events, family cohesion/friction, living conditions, attitude, and knowledge of illness.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h4>PHYSICAL EXAMINATION</h4>

                    <p>Full physical examination is essential for all inpatients. The need for a complete physical examination in an outpatient setting tends to be based on presenting complaints and/or the availability of adequate facilities/time constraints.</p>
                    
                    <p>There really can be no excuse for overlooking systemic comorbidities‚Äîat the very least, arrange for the primary care physician to review the patient or reschedule a longer appointment somewhere where facilities are available.</p>
                    
                    <p>A full neurological examination may be the most important investigation and should focus on:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Gait inspection</li>
                      <li>Examination of the extremities for weakness and/or altered sensation</li>
                      <li>Examination of hand‚Äìeye coordination</li>
                      <li>Examination of smooth ocular pursuit</li>
                      <li>Examination of the cranial nerves</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>Scales, such as AIMS, may be useful to record and monitor potential movement side effects of medication.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Neurological Examination:</h4>

                    <p>Begin with a focused neurological examination, as abnormalities in neurological function can impact the presentation of schizophrenia. Assess cranial nerve function, motor strength, coordination, and reflexes. Pay special attention to signs of abnormal involuntary movements, which may be associated with antipsychotic medication side effects.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Cardiovascular System:</h4>
                    
                    <p>Evaluate the cardiovascular system, with a focus on monitoring the effects of antipsychotic medications. Assess blood pressure, heart rate, and rhythm. Antipsychotics can sometimes lead to metabolic disturbances, necessitating a baseline cardiovascular assessment and ongoing monitoring.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Respiratory System:</h4>
                    
                    <p>Conduct a basic respiratory examination to identify any respiratory conditions or complications. Schizophrenia patients may be more vulnerable to respiratory infections due to factors such as poor self-care, social isolation, or medication side effects.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Dermatological Examination:</h4>
                    
                    <p>Examine the skin for any adverse reactions to psychotropic medications. Certain antipsychotics can cause dermatological side effects, such as rash or photosensitivity. Early detection of these issues is crucial for adjusting medications and preventing complications.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Endocrine and Metabolic Assessment:</h4>
                    
                    <p>Monitor for signs of metabolic syndrome, a common concern with long-term antipsychotic use. Assess weight, waist circumference, and inquire about changes in appetite and thirst. Additionally, monitor fasting blood glucose and lipid levels regularly.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Gastrointestinal Examination:</h4>
                    
                    <p>Consider gastrointestinal health, especially as it relates to potential side effects of antipsychotic medications. Patients may experience constipation or other gastrointestinal issues. Inquire about dietary habits, and address any concerns related to nutrition and digestive health.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Musculoskeletal Examination:</h4>
                    
                    <p>Perform a musculoskeletal examination to assess for any movement disorders or extrapyramidal symptoms associated with antipsychotic medications. Look for signs of rigidity, tremors, and abnormal postures, which may impact the patient's overall functioning.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Genitourinary System:</h4>
                    
                    <p>Inquire about urinary symptoms and assess the genitourinary system, as antipsychotic medications can sometimes cause issues such as urinary retention. Document any changes in urinary frequency, urgency, or difficulties.</p>

                    <p>There is currently no cure for schizophrenia. Treatment is aimed at reducing symptoms and preventing psychotic relapses.</p>
                    
                    <h4>BIOLOGICAL</h4>
                    <h4>Pharmacological</h4>
                    
                    <p>Two major types of antipsychotic medications (or neuroleptics):</p>
                    
                    <h5>CONVENTIONAL or TYPICAL ANTIPSYCHOTICS (e.g., haloperidol)</h5>
                    
                    <ul>
                      <li>Control the positive symptoms very effectively.</li>
                      <li>Side effects: extrapyramidal symptoms (chronic: tardive dyskinesia, parkinsonism, akathisia; acute: acute dystonia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome).</li>
                      <li>High affinity for D2 dopamine receptors.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h5>NEWER or ATYPICAL ANTIPSYCHOTICS (e.g., clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, ziprasidone, quetiapine, sertindole)</h5>
                    
                    <ul>
                      <li>Better at treating the negative symptoms.</li>
                      <li>Milder motor side effects; but others (weight gain, diabetes).</li>
                      <li>They have affinity for multiple receptors.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>The acute psychotic schizophrenic patients will usually respond to antipsychotic medication.</p>

                    <p>According to the current consensus, first-line therapy involves the use of newer atypical antipsychotics. This choice is preferred as their use is not complicated by the appearance of extrapyramidal side effects, or these effects are much lower than with classical antipsychotics.</p>
                    
                    <p>Medication Dosages:</p>

                    <ul>
                      <li>Chlorpromazine: 300-1500 mg/day PO; 50-100 mg/day IM</li>
                      <li>Fluphenazine decanoate: 25-50 mg IM every 1-3 weeks</li>
                      <li>Haloperidol: 5-100 mg/day PO; 5-20 mg/day IM</li>
                      <li>Trifluoperazine: 15-60 mg/day PO; 1-5 mg/day IM</li>
                      <li>Clozapine: 25-450 mg/day PO</li>
                      <li>Risperidone: 2-10 mg/day PO</li>
                    </ul>
                       
                    
                    <h4>Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT)</h4>

                    <p>ECT is a safe and effective treatment for various conditions, including:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                      <li>Major Depressive Disorder</li>
                      <li>Bipolar Disorder</li>
                      <li>Catatonia</li>
                      <li>Schizophrenia</li>
                      <li>And several other conditions</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>ECT involves using an electric current to induce a seizure in the brain, providing rapid relief for severe symptoms of mental illness. It is recommended when:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                      <li>Patient does not improve with medication or psychotherapy</li>
                      <li>Severity of symptoms is life-threatening</li>
                      <li>Co-morbid conditioons that make ECT a safer option such as a history of nuroleptic malignant syndrome</li>
                      <li>Depression or suicidal ideation that does not improve with medication or therapy</li>
                      <li>Catatonia, a state of reduced movement and responsiveness</li>
                    </ul>
                    

                    <h4>PSYCHOLOGICAL THERAPIES</h4>
                    <p>Several psychological therapies can be beneficial in the treatment of schizophrenia, including:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT):</strong> Focuses on identifying and changing negative thought patterns and behaviors contributing to symptoms.</li>

                      <li><strong>Dynamic Psychotherapy:</strong> A therapeutic approach that explores unconscious processes and aims for insight into emotional conflicts.</li>
                      <li><strong>Family Therapy:</strong> Involves working with the family to improve communication, understanding, and support for the individual with schizophrenia.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>SOCIAL TREATMENT</h4>
                    <p><strong>Occupational Therapy</strong></p>
