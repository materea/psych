                <li>All actions of <strong>psychiatrists</strong> in helping the <strong>law</strong> carry out some of its responsibilities.</li>
                <li>A <strong>forensic psychiatrist</strong> is a psychiatrist who has additional training and/or experience related to the various interfaces of <strong>mental health/illness</strong> with the <strong>law</strong>.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>When legal matters involve issues outside lay (general public) expertise, lawyers and judges regularly seek consultation from professionals in a wide variety of fields, including medical specialties.</li>
                <li>Such professionals are often called "<strong>experts</strong>" or "<strong>expert witnesses</strong>."</li>
                <li>Forensic experts usually are truly knowledgeable, the criteria for "<strong>expert</strong>" designation in such cases are legal ones, and not necessarily scientific.</li>
                <li>Sometimes the expertise is sought in an effort to provide the best possible information to judges or juries, but there are many other situations in which a prudent attorney, judge, or other party may request consultation.</li>

                <li>civil litigation (such as malpractice lawsuits)</li>

                <li>child custody</li>
                <li>treating and working with mentally ill people who get in trouble with the law</li>
                <li>helping victims of crimes</li>
                <li>helping lawyers and judges understand the psychological aspects of their cases.</li>

                <li>Association between low IQ and delinquency - Rutter & Gilles - not due to likelihood of duller offenders being caught.</li>
            </ul>

                <li>Antisocial personality disorder and substance disorders have a greater association with offending than other major mental disorders.</li>

                <li>Act itself - guilty act/<em>actus reus</em>.</li>
                <li>A concurrence in time between both.</li>
                <li>Prove above beyond reasonable doubt before conviction recorded for most offenses.</li>

                <li>For example, in English law, children under 10 years are excluded because they are deemed incapable of forming criminal intent (<em>doli incapax</em>).</li>

            </ul>
            
            <h4>Mental Disorder: M'Naghten Rule</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Defendant suffers from a disease of the mind at the time of the offense.</li>
                <li>Caused a defect of reason which:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Robbed them of capacity to know action or know it was wrong ‚Äì M'Naghten rules.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Every person is presumed sane until the contrary is proved.</li>
                <li>To establish the defense of insanity, prove that the accused was laboring under a defect of reason, from disease of mind, so as not to know the nature/quality of the act they were doing, or if they knew it, did not know they were doing wrong (at the time of the offense).</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Insanity</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Suffers from a disease of the mind/natural mental infirmity which:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Deprived them of the capacity to understand action or control action or</li>
                    <li>Know they ought not to do/make omission - natural mental infirmity and uncontrollable impulse differentiate from M'Naghten.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Diminished Responsibility</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Shades of mental impairment can affect mens rea, not necessarily completely nullifying it.</li>
                <li>Lesser degree of intent.</li>
                <li>Applicable only to murder.</li>
                <li>Responsibility diminished.</li>
                <li>Not guilty of murder but manslaughter.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Alcohol/Drugs Effect</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Intoxication not in itself a defense. If involuntary or non-consensual, or caused by malicious act or negligence of another - yes.</li>
                <li>Voluntary intoxication ‚Äì exculpates if drugs caused disease of mind (McNaughton).</li>
                <li>If drugs lead to mind abnormality to impair responsibility (Diminished Responsibility).</li>
                <li>If a requirement of specific intent for a crime, e.g., murder, evidence of intoxication may be used to show inability to form that intent.</li>
            </ul>

        <div class='body'>
            <h4></h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Psychiatrists are called to evaluate capacity, e.g., write a will, enter a contract, psychological autopsy.</li>
                <li>Determination of incapacity results in social control of the individual.</li>
                <li>Need to be ethical and make sure your decision is based on the best available clinical evidence.</li>
                <li>Assumed in law that a person is competent to make decisions unless proven otherwise.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Capacity Recommendations</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Major mental disorder does not automatically produce incapacity in general - capacity may fluctuate/competency is not an all or none concept but tied to a specific decision/function to be accomplished.</li>
                <li>Finding of incapacity should be time-limited - review from time to time. For example, a stroke patient may be incompetent to drive but may be competent to make contracts or manage finances. With treatment/rehabilitation, they may regain capacity.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Testamentary Capacity</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Ability to write a valid will.</li>
                <li>Also refers to capacity to understand the nature and effects of writing a will.</li>
                <li>Testator must understand the nature of the will and its implications.</li>
                <li>Must know the nature and extent of property.</li>
                <li>Must know people who may expect to be beneficiaries even though they choose to exclude them.</li>
                <li>Must not suffer from a disorder of the mind.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Power of Attorney</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Impairment of ability to manage affairs may cause problems for relatives and associates.</li>
                <li>Relatives may apply and obtain a power of attorney to manage the property and affairs of such an ill member.</li>
                <li>Durable power of attorney - Permits persons to make provision for anticipated loss of decision-making capacity and advance selection of a decision-maker to act in proxy when illness/dementia sets in.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Entering into Contracts</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Validity of a contract entered into by a mentally ill individual depends on the test of their capacity to understand the nature of the contract and its implications.</li>
                <li>Does not depend on diagnosis or status, e.g., detained.</li>
                <li>Incapable patients require protection, as do those who transact business with them.</li>
                <li>A mentally incapable patient is bound by their contract, unless they can show the other party knew of their incapacity when they made the contract.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Competence to be Executed</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>New area of competence that emerged.</li>
                <li>Requirement anchored on:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Punishment is meaningless unless the offender is aware of what is going on - must be mentally able to make whatever peace is appropriate with religion, e.g., confession.</li>
                    <li>Possibility of recalling forgotten details of events or crimes that may prove exonerating.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Ethical issues - physician‚Äôs duty to preserve life transcends competing requirements.</li>
            </ul>

          </h2>
        </header>
        <div class='body'>
            <ul>
                <li>Rising wave of legalism, mental health not immune.</li>
                <li>Why?</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Patients have greater expectations of doctors.</li>
                    <li>Competitive nature of legal practice.</li>
                    <li>Innovations in medicine requiring greater skills/knowledge. By definition, it means,</li>
                    <li>Intervention given which falls below acceptable standards of practice allowed - judicial principle.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

            <h4>Proof of Malpractice</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>A doctor-patient relationship, creating a duty of care.</li>
                <li>Deviation from the standard of care.</li>
                <li>Damage to the patient.</li>
                <li>Direct causation between deviation and damage.</li>
                <li>4D‚Äôs - each must be present. Preponderance of evidence required.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Example of Malpractice</h4>
                <p>Liabilities include <strong>failure to properly evaluate</strong>, <strong>negligent prescription practices</strong> (exceeding dose, using wrong meds, failure to disclose side effects), <strong>ECT with undiagnosed fracture</strong>, <strong>failure to obtain informed consent</strong> resulting in irreversible damage (<strong>T.D.</strong>), suicides, boundary violations, <strong>mechanical restraint causing disability</strong>, <strong>breach of confidentiality</strong>, <strong>prolonged and unnecessary incarceration</strong> that is ultra vires, <strong>absconding patient kills self</strong> (<em>Dickson Igbokwe vs. U.C.H.</em>).</p>
                
            
            <h4>Violence and Malpractice</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>May be sued for failure to control aggressive outpatients and for discharge of violent inpatients.</li>
                <li>Tarasoff v University of California regents - Supreme Court ruled that endangered third parties must be notified.</li>
                <li>Required to predict future behavior of violent patients - poor performance here.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Tarasoff 1</h4>
            <p>Poddar (student/outpatient) told therapist of intention to kill Tatiana Tarasoff.</p>
            <p>Therapist decided to commit but supervisor vetoed.</p>
            <p>Poddar absconded from clinic and killed her.</p>
            <p>Psychiatrist believing patient may injure/kill must notify potential victim/relative/authority.</p>
            
            <h4>Tarasoff 2</h4>
            <p>1982 - California Supreme Court ruled on duty to protect, broadening earlier ruling.</p>
            <p>Relates to release of violent patients.</p>
            <p>Never discharge without adequate follow-up.</p>
            
            <h4>Critique of Tarasoff Decisions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Informing at the beginning of the session of a possible breach of confidentiality may deter individuals from entering therapy, thus putting the public at greater peril from potentially violent individuals who go untreated.</li>
                <li>Such patients may not talk about the violence, thus diminishing the value of psychotherapy.</li>
                <li>Therapists could overreact and practice defensively by warning too often.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Vicarious Liability</h4>
            <p>Legal Doctrine.</p>
            
            <h4>Respondeat Superior</h4>
            <p>Servant‚Äôs act considered to be that of master - Let the master answer for the deeds of the servant.</p>
