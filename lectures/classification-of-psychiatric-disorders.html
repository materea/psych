            <h4>Definitions</h4>
            <p>
              <strong>Classification-</strong><br>
              The process by which the complexity of phenomena is reduced by arranging them into categories according to some established criteria for one or more purposes.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              <strong>A disorder-</strong><br>
              An assumption is that a psychiatric disorder is any emotion, thought, or behavior that is "abnormal."
            </p>
            
            <h4>Normalcy and Abnormality</h4>
            <p>
              Normalcy or what is considered abnormal varies widely and depends on the patient's or (clinician's):
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Ethnic or cultural background,</li>
              <li>Religious or moral values,</li>
              <li>Upbringing, and</li>
              <li>Age or generational cohort.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
              <strong>DSM-IV-TR definition of disorders:</strong><br>
              As syndromes of symptoms or behaviors associated with distress or disability or with a significant increase risk of suffering, death, pain, disability, or an important loss of freedom.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              <strong>Symptoms-</strong> are the patient's subjective experience and may include thoughts, feelings, behavior, and physical sensations.<br>
              <strong>Signs-</strong> are the clinician's objective observations of the patient.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <strong>Note:</strong> In psychiatry, no behavioral symptom or mental status finding is pathognomonic for one specific diagnosis. For example, auditory hallucination can be seen in schizophrenia, mania, severe depression with psychotic features, cocaine or stimulant intoxication, vascular dementia, or even severe borderline personality disorder.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Classification of mental disorders consists of specific mental disorders that are grouped into various classes on the basis of some shared phenomenological characteristics. Ideally, a classification of disorders is based on knowledge of aetiology or pathophysiology.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Neuroscientists have not yet produced sufficient data to design a diagnostic system that relies on biomarkers that enable psychiatric diagnoses to be based on causes rather than symptoms.
              </p>

              <p>
                Instead, diagnosis of mental disorders is based on clinical observations of clusters of signs and symptoms that are grouped together into disorders or syndromes. These classifications are then agreed upon by a consensus of psychiatrists and other mental health professionals.

            <p>
              <strong>Organic Disorders-</strong><br>
              Arise from demonstrable cerebral or systemic pathological processes, e.g., Dementia, delirium, and various neuropsychiatric syndromes.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              <strong>Functional-</strong><br>
              Is an umbrella or default term for all other psychiatric disorders. The implication of organic/functional classification:
            </p>
            
            <ol>
              <li>
                Functional disorders have no biological basis, while psychological and social factors are irrelevant for organic disorders‚Äîthis is not true.
              </li>
              <li>
                Practical implication: Organic defines disorders aetiologically, whereas all other psychiatric disorders are purely descriptive and are based on clusters of symptoms and signs.
              </li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>
              <strong>Note:</strong> The organic-functional dichotomy is neither valid nor helpful and should be abandoned.

          </h2>

            <h4></h4>

            <p>
              Applies to schemes of classifications in which 2 or more separate sets of information (e.g., symptoms, etiology, and personality type) are coded.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Was first proposed by Essen-Moller and is now an integral part of DSM-IV & V, available within ICD-10.
            </p>

            <h4>Hierarchies of Diagnosis</h4>

            <p>
              If two or more disorders are present, it is conventional to assume that one takes precedence and is regarded as the main disorder for the purposes of treatment and recording. For example, an organic disorder takes precedence over schizophrenia, and schizophrenia over mood disorder.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              There is some clinical evidence for an inbuilt hierarchy of significance between disorders. For instance, anxiety symptoms commonly occur with depressive disorders and are sometimes the presenting features. Anxiety may receive little response, but if the depressive disorder is treated, there is improvement in anxiety as well as depressive symptoms.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                It encourages the clinician to focus on all the various disorders that may be present and not assume that the disorder highest in the hierarchy is necessarily the only or even the most important target for treatment.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Diagnostic "rule" used in the current classificatory system, especially in DSM-V, encourages multiple diagnoses.
              </p>
              
              <h4>Co-morbidity (Dual Diagnosis)</h4>

              <ul>
                <li>Less emphasis is now placed on hierarchies of diagnosis, but greater weight is now placed on co-morbidity.</li>
                <li>For the following reasons:</li>
              </ul>
              
              <ul>
                <li>Research has shown that co-morbidity is very common. For example, 50% of patients with major depressive disorder also meet criteria for an anxiety disorder.</li>
                <li>Co-morbidity covers two different circumstances:</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Disorders that are currently considered distinct but are probably causally related, i.e., one disease process but two or more clinical manifestations, which are currently diagnosed separately due to lack of knowledge or because of clinical convention. Example: Depressive disorder and anxiety disorder.</li>
                  <li>Disorders that are causally unrelated, i.e., the chance of co-occurrence of two disorders is unlikely. Example: Pre-senile dementia in a person with long-standing panic disorder.</li>
