            <h4>Differences from Adult Psychiatry</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>Children rarely initiate consultations - <strong>Adults</strong> does this.</li>
              <li>Healthy children may sometimes be brought for consultation by overanxious or solicitous parents/teachers (severely disturbed children could sometimes be left to themselves) <strong>because</strong>:</li>
              <li>Psychological problems in a child may be a manifestation of disturbances in other member(s) of the family.</li>
              <li>To decide <strong>Normal</strong> from <strong>Abnormal</strong> - Great attention is paid to the stage of development of the child (Give example).</li>
              <li>Children are less able to express self verbally - <strong>non-verbal</strong> observations (e.g., Play) essential.</li>
              <li>The treatment of children with psychiatric or psychological disorders makes less use of medication - Need team work.
                <p><strong>Emphasis</strong> is changing attitudes of parents, reassuring, restraining children, work with family, etc.</p>
              </li>
            </ol>
            
            <h4>Definition of Childhood Psychiatric Disorder</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>A change</strong> in the child's usual behavior, emotion, or thoughts</li>
              <li><strong>Persistent</strong> - for at least two weeks</li>
              <li><strong>Severe enough</strong> to interfere with the child's everyday life</li>
              <li><strong>A handicap</strong> to the child and/or the carers</li>
              <li><strong>Taking account</strong> of the child's stage of development</li>
              <li><strong>Taking account</strong> of the socio-cultural context</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Main Groups of Childhood Disorders</h4>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Adjustment reactions</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Pervasive developmental disorders</strong></li>

            </ol>
            
            <h4>Epidemiology Generally</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Behavioral</strong> & <strong>emotional disorders</strong> occur frequently in the general population of children.</li>
              <li>Rates are similar between <strong>developed</strong> & <strong>developing countries</strong>.</li>
              <li>Frequency varies with age (the older, the more).</li>
              <li>Higher rates are observed in <strong>urban</strong> areas than in <strong>rural</strong> areas.</li>
              <li><strong>Boys</strong> have a prevalence rate twice as high as <strong>girls</strong>.</li>
              <li>Prevalence increases as <strong>IQ</strong> reduces.</li>

            <h4>Constitutional factors: Genetic & Chromosomal abnormalities e.g. phenylketonuria, Down's syndrome, etc.</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Brain disorders from any cause:</strong> This is the most important physical disease that can predispose to psychological problems in childhood.</li>
              <li><strong>Minimal brain dysfunction:</strong> History of abnormal pregnancy, prematurity, and birth asphyxia.</li>
              <li><strong>Maturational changes and delayed effects:</strong> Damage in early life may not become manifest until later in life.</li>
              <li><strong>Epilepsy:</strong> Repeated seizures lead to psychiatric disorders.</li>
              <li>Age of onset; Side effects of medications; Psychological & social consequences may lead to emotional & behavioral disorders.</li>
              <li><strong>Lead poisoning/intoxication:</strong> Causes intellectual impairment & behavioral disorders secondary to impaired brain development.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Temperamental Factors</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Children</strong> are born with a tendency towards reacting to people and events in specific ways.</li>
              <li><strong>Easy children:</strong> Positive approach, rapid adaptation & mild behavioral response.</li>
              <li><strong>Difficult children:</strong> Withdrawal, slow adaptation & intense behavioral response.</li>
              <li><strong>Slow to warm up children:</strong> Relatively inactive, reflective, tend to withdraw or to react negatively to novelty, but gradually become more positive with experience.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Child Risk Factors for Psychiatric Disorders</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Low IQ</strong> - as high as 40% risk with severe learning difficulties</li>
              <li><strong>Difficult temperament</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Physical illness</strong>: 20% or more risk with epilepsy, slight increased risk with most other illnesses</li>
              <li><strong>Specific developmental delay</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Communication difficulty</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Academic failure</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Low self-esteem</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Family Factors that Increase the Risk of Psychiatric Disorder</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Family breakdown:</strong> Divorce, etc.</li>
              <li><strong>Parental</strong> (especially <strong>Maternal</strong>) <strong>mental ill health</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Paternal</strong> criminality, alcoholism, psychopathy (antisocial disorder)</li>
              <li><strong>Abuse</strong> (physical, emotional, sexual, and neglect)</li>
              <li><strong>Poverty/low social status</strong> - whatever the cause</li>
              <li>Death and loss - including loss of friendships</li>
              
            </ul>

            <h4><em>Parenting Styles</em></h4>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Authoritative parenting:</strong> Has benefits over the others. Generally, children of such parents perform well in all domains (social competence, psychosocial development, and instrumental competence). They have more friends, better school performance, more self-discipline, and emotional self-control.</li>
              <li><strong>Authoritarian parenting:</strong> The children may do well academically and behaviorally but they are poor in social skills, have low self-esteem, and an increased level of depression and risk of suicide.</li>
              <li><strong>Indulgent parenting:</strong> Produces children that are more likely to be involved in problem behaviors e.g. substance abuse, deviant behavior, and school misconduct; they have a lower level of academic performance but better social skills and lower levels of depression.</li>
              <li><strong>Uninvolved parenting:</strong> Children from uninvolved families perform most poorly in all the domains.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>External Factors that Increase the Risk of Psychiatric Disorder</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>School:</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>Poor organization and unclear discipline</li>
                  <li>Lack of awareness of children as individuals</li>
                  <li>High teacher turnover, low morale</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Sociocultural influences:</strong> Living in areas of social disadvantage</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Factors (Some) that Protect Against Psychiatric Disorder</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Positive self-image</strong></li>
              <li>Affectionate relationships</li>
              <li>Supportive relationships with adults including those outside the family e.g. school, religious organizations & individuals.</li>
              <li><strong>Stable personality traits</strong></li>
              <li>Having a special skill</li>
              <li><strong>High IQ</strong> & <strong>Academic achievement</strong> with capacity for problem solving in the child.</li>
              <li><strong>Good mothering</strong></li>
              <li>Parents who give high levels of supervision and clear discipline</li>

                                  <li>Start early before child has a sense of failure</li>
                                  <li>Extra teaching & Parental interest are important</li>
                                  <li>Use several senses to learn - like listening to a taped lesson and tracing with a finger the shape of the words spoken can help process the information</li>

                            <h4>Also known as dyscalculia</h4>
                            <p>Dyscalculia, a lesser-known learning disorder, affects a person‚Äôs ability to comprehend and manipulate numbers and mathematical concepts. Much like its more famous counterpart, dyslexia, which disrupts reading-related brain areas, dyscalculia targets the neural regions responsible for mathematical skills and understanding.</p>
                            <p>However, it is essential to recognize that their difficulties do not reflect diminished intelligence or capability. Dyscalculia symptoms typically emerge during childhood, especially when children begin learning basic math. Surprisingly, many adults unknowingly grapple with dyscalculia as well.</p>

                            <h4>Key Differences: Dyslexia vs. Dyscalculia</h4>
                            <p>While both dyslexia and dyscalculia fall under the umbrella of ‚ÄúSpecific Learning Disorder‚Äù in the American Psychiatric Association‚Äôs Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), they exhibit distinct characteristics:</p>
                            <ul>
                              <li><strong>Dyscalculia:</strong>
                                <ul>
                                  <li>Impairs mathematical abilities.</li>
                                  <li>Challenges understanding and manipulating numbers.</li>
                                  <li>Often leads to anxiety, depression, and other emotional struggles related to math.</li>
                                  <li>May manifest later in life (acquired dyscalculia) due to medical conditions or other factors.</li>
                                </ul>
                              </li>

                                <ul>
                                  <li>Affects reading abilities.</li>
                                  <li>Involves difficulties with reading, spelling, and language comprehension.</li>
                                  <li>Can coexist with dyscalculia.</li>
                                </ul>

                      <h4>Hyperactivity-impulsive behavior</h4>

                      <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Every child is unique, with a distinct personality and temperament. Children should never be classified as having ADHD just because they're different from their friends or siblings.</p>
                      <p>Symptoms may be different in boys & girls:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Boys are more likely hyperactive. Inattentive boys are more likely to play or fiddle aimlessly. Boys are less compliant with teachers & other adults, so their behavior is often more obvious.</li>
                        <li>Girls tend to be inattentive.</li>
                      </ul>
                      
                      <p>Common finding in ADHD: They are sensitive to stimuli like sights, sounds, and touch.</p>
                      <p>When over-stimulated, they get out of control (sometimes aggressive or even physically or verbally abusive).</p>
                      <p>Inattentive form of ADHD:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Drift away into their own thoughts</li>
                        <li>Lose track of what's going on around them</li>
                      </ul>
                      

                      <p>Treatment involves medication, psychotherapy, or both.</p>
                      <p>Psychotherapy:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Talk about issues that bother them</li>
                        <li>Explore negative behavioral patterns and learn ways to deal with the symptoms</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>Behavior therapy:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Helps teachers and parents learn strategies for dealing with the child's behavior</li>
                        <li>Strategies may include: Token reward systems, timeouts, and behavior modification</li>
                      </ul>
                      
                      <p>Others</p>

                      <ul>
                        <li>Family therapy: Help parents & siblings deal with the stress of living with the patient.</li>
                        <li>Social skills training: Help children learn appropriate social behaviors.</li>
                        <li>Support groups: Offer a network of social support, information, and education.</li>
                        <li>Parenting skills training: Help parents develop ways to understand and guide their child's behavior.</li>
                        <li>Academics and work intervention</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>For best results: Use a team approach with teachers, parents, and therapists or physicians working together.</p>

                          <p>The most commonly prescribed & used, e.g. Methylphenidate (Ritalin, Concerta). These medications increase brain dopamine by blocking the activity of dopamine transporters, which remove dopamine after it has been released.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>

                      </ol>
                      <p>Beware of side effects.</p>
