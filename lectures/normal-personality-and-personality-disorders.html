            <h4>What is Personality</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>an assemblage of <strong>personal qualities</strong>,</li>
              <li>an <strong>appearance</strong> of the person to others,</li>
              <li>the <strong>role</strong> played by the person, and</li>
              <li>the <strong>qualities</strong> and <strong>dignity</strong> that distinguish the individual from others.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>According to Jaspers:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>the particular way an individual <strong>expresses himself</strong>, <strong>moves</strong>, <strong>experiences</strong>, and <strong>reacts to situations</strong>,</li>
              <li><strong>loves</strong>,</li>
              <li>expresses <strong>jealousy</strong>,</li>
              <li>conducts life in general,</li>
              <li>his/her <strong>needs</strong>, <strong>ideals</strong>, and how they are shaped,</li>
              <li>his/her <strong>values</strong>, etc.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Consequently, Jaspers summarized personality as the ‚Äú<strong>individually differing</strong> and <strong>characteristic</strong> totality of meaningful connections in any one psychic life‚Äù.</p>

            <h4>Personality Models</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Idiographic:</strong> This considers each individual as unique.</li>
              <li><strong>Normothetic:</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>More popular of the two models.</li>
                  <li>Comprises of theories that explain personality in terms of shared attributes of a population.</li>
                  <li>People differ only in a limited number of variables.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Normothetic theory subcategories are:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Type Approach:</strong> The type theories are categorical or non-continuous, i.e., you either have the type or not. For example, distinct diagnostic categories of personality types.</li>
              <li><strong>Trait Approach:</strong> Here, the variables are continuous in nature from one person to the other, and there are many personality traits that are known over the years.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Normal Personality Types/Traits</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Clinical Approach:</strong>
                <p>This is based on the collective experiences of clinicians, such as sociable, outgoing, solitary, confident, etc.</p>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Psychologists'/Statistical Approach:</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>Use statistical methods to discover which traits (e.g., anxiety, flexibility, energy, hostility, moodiness, impulsiveness, orderliness, self-reliance) cluster as ‚Äòpersonality factors‚Äô.</li>
                </ul>

          </h2>
        </header>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Sir F Galton</strong> was the first scientist to recognize what is now known as the lexical hypothesis:
                <ul>
                  <li>This is the idea that the most salient and socially relevant personality differences in people‚Äôs lives will eventually become encoded into language.</li>
                  <li>The hypothesis further suggests that by sampling language, it is possible to derive a comprehensive taxonomy of human personality traits.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                In <strong>1936</strong>, <strong>Gordon Allport</strong> and <strong>H. S. Odbert</strong> put the lexical hypothesis into practice.
                <ul>
                  <li>They worked through two of the most comprehensive dictionaries of the English language available at the time.</li>
                  <li>Extracted <strong>17,953</strong> personality-describing words.</li>
                  <li>Then reduced this gigantic list to <strong>4,504</strong> adjectives.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>

              <li>Raymond Cattell's Contributions</li>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Raymond Cattell</strong> obtained the Allport-Odbert list in the 1940s:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Added terms obtained from psychological research and eliminated synonyms to reduce the total to <strong>171</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Asked subjects to rate people whom they knew by the adjectives on the list and analyzed their ratings.</li>
                    <li>He identified <strong>35</strong> major clusters of personality traits which he referred to as the "personality sphere."</li>
                    <li>He and his associates then constructed personality tests for these traits.</li>
                    <li>Data obtained from these tests were analyzed with the emerging technology of computers combined with the statistical method of factor analysis.</li>
                    <li>This resulted in sixteen major personality factors, which led to the development of the <strong>16 Personality Questionnaire</strong>.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
              
              <li>Ernest Tupes and Raymond Christal's Contributions</li>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Ernest Tupes and Raymond Christal</strong>:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Analyzed personality data from eight large samples.</li>
                    <li>Using Cattell's trait measures, they found five recurring factors, which they named "Surgency," "Agreeableness," "Dependability," "Emotional Stability," and "Culture."</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
              
              <p><strong>Raymond Cattell's Perspective:</strong></p>
              <p>Raymond Cattell viewed these developments as an attack on his 16PF model and never agreed with the growing Five Factor consensus. He refers to "...the five-factor heresy," which he considers "...is partly directed against the 16PF test."</p>
            </ul>


            <h4>1981 Symposium in Honolulu</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                In a <strong>1981 symposium</strong> in <strong>Honolulu</strong>:
                <ul>
                  <li>Lewis Goldberg, Naomi Takemoto-Chock, Andrew Comrey, and John M. Digman reviewed the available personality tests of the day.</li>
                  <li>They concluded that the tests which held the most promise measured a subset of five common factors, just as Norman had discovered in <strong>1963</strong>.</li>
                  <li>This event was followed by widespread acceptance of the <strong>Five Factor Model</strong> among personality researchers during the <strong>1980s</strong>.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>

            <p><strong>Definition of Disorder:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Abnormal behavior which is persistent, pervasive, and causes distress and disability either to the individual or to people around him/her.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Definition of Personality Disorder:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>It is an enduring pattern of inner experience and behavior that:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Deviates markedly from the expectations of the individual‚Äôs culture,</li>
                <li>Is pervasive and inflexible,</li>
                <li>Has an onset in adolescence or early adulthood,</li>
                <li>Is stable over time, and</li>
                <li>Leads to distress or impairment (DSM-IV).</li>
              </ul>
            </ul>
            

            <h4>Epidemiology</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>10-15% of population</li>
              <li>Prevalence could be up to 80% in some groupings e.g. prison, cult societies</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Aetiological Factors</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Genetic (quite clear in Normal personality as opposed to PD)</li>
              <li>Biological factors (e.g. aggressive behavior/impulsivity associated with decreased 5-HT)</li>
              <li>Environment:

            <h4>Diagnosis</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Age limit: ‚â• 18 years</li>
              <li>There must be the following ('3 Ps' of PD):</li>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Pathological:</strong> Pathological symptoms in the domains of cognition, affect, impulse control, and interpersonal relationship.</li>
                <li><strong>Pervasive:</strong> Impairment in a person‚Äôs life is widespread across roles (intimate, social, and occupational roles).</li>
                <li><strong>Persistent:</strong> The pattern is stable and of long duration traceable back to adolescence or early adulthood.</li>

                          <li>The therapeutic aim is to define the patient‚Äôs presenting problems, set goals, and modify dysfunctional thinking and associated behaviors that prevent adaptive functioning.</li>
                          <li>The clinician‚Äôs role is to teach the patient to identify and modify dysfunctional thoughts and beliefs.</li>
                          <li>CBT was originally devised for the treatment of depression but has expanded to other Axis I disorders and to personality (Axis II) disorders.</li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>

                      <li><strong>Dialectical Behavioural Therapy (DBT):</strong>
                        <ul>
                          <li>A form of cognitive therapy developed by Marshal Lineham.</li>
                          <li>Originally used in the treatment of repeatedly parasuicidal female patients with borderline personality disorder.</li>
                          <li>Leads to a marked reduction in the frequency of self-harm episodes.</li>
                          <li>Emphasis of this manual-based therapy is on the development of coping skills to improve affective stability and impulse control and on reducing self-harmful behavior.</li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>
                      <li><strong>Interpersonal Therapy (IT):</strong>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Based on the fact that patient‚Äôs difficulties result from a limited range of interpersonal relationships, including such issues as role definition.</li>
                          <li>Posits that people may develop characteristic maladaptive styles of relating that are self-reinforcing, which can be altered by interactions with others that can force patients to engage in new patterns of behavior in controlled settings.</li>
                          <li>The treatment can be delivered individually but is most effective when carried out in couple, family, or group.</li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>

                      <li><strong>Group Therapy:</strong>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Allows interpersonal psychopathology to display itself among peer patients whose behaviors are used by the therapist to identify and correct maladaptive ideas, communication, and behavior.</li>
                          <li>Sessions are held once weekly over a course that may range from several months to years.</li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>
                      <li><strong>Therapeutic Community:</strong>
                        <ul>
                          <li>A therapeutic community is defined as an intensive form of treatment in which the environmental setting becomes the core therapy through which behavior can be challenged and modified (essentially through group pressure).</li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                    

                    <h4>Drug Treatment</h4>
                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>Medications</strong> are not curative for PDs, but are used as adjunct for the patient to productively engage in psychotherapy.</li>
                      <li>The focus is on treatment of symptom clusters such as <strong>cognitive-perceptual symptoms</strong>, <strong>affective dysregulation</strong>, and <strong>impulsive-behavioral dyscontrol</strong>.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>Antipsychotic drugs:</strong>
                        <ul>
                          <li>They are the most widely used in the treatment of personality disorders, especially those that can produce transient psychotic periods (e.g., BPD) or in those with features of chronic idiosyncratic ideation of nearly psychotic proportions (e.g., Schizotypal PD).</li>
                          <li>However, there is considerable confusion about their <strong>values</strong>.</li>
                          <li>Low doses of haloperidol and thiothexene are effective in reducing typical borderline and schizotypal symptoms.</li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>
                      <li><strong>Antidepressants:</strong>
                        <ul>
                          <li>TCAs and SSRIs have been used in the treatment of PDs, most especially the borderline type.</li>
                          <li>SSRIs reduce <strong>impulsiveness</strong>.</li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>
                      <li><strong>Mood Stabilizers:</strong>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Lithium, Carbamazepine, and sodium valproate have all been used to treat PDs, particularly the borderline type.</li>
                          <li>Mood stabilizers have some demonstrable efficacy in suppressing <strong>impulsive</strong> and particularly <strong>aggressive behavior</strong> in patients with PDs.</li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>
