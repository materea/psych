            <ul>
                <li>The link between psychiatric and physical disorders is well established.</li>
                <li>Depression is more common in people with chronic illnesses (e.g., angina, asthma, arthritis, and diabetes).</li>
                <li>Comorbidity of depression with these chronic conditions produces significantly greater decrements in health than from one or more of the cases of the chronic disease.</li>
                <li>The additive effect is particularly amplified in the case of depression comorbid with diabetes.</li>
                <li>Depression delays recovery from physical illness and increases the risk of death following myocardial infarction and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Reasons for the High Prevalence of Psychiatric Illness Among Medical Patients</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Pre-existing psychiatric illness contributing to the development of physical illness.</li>
                <li>Psychological reaction to physical illness.</li>
                <li>Organic effects of illness on mental function (e.g., Delirium, dementia, organic affective disorders).</li>
                <li>The effects of medically prescribed drugs on mental function and behavior.</li>
                <li>Medically unexplained symptoms that mask underlying psychiatric illness.</li>
                <li>Alcohol and drug misuse.</li>
            </ol>

                    <h4>Pre-existing Psychiatric Illness Contributing to the Development of Physical Illness</h4>
                    <p>People with psychiatric illness are more likely than the general population to develop one or more physical disorders.</p>
                    <p>Common psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety disorders predispose to obesity and its multiple complications, such as diabetes, osteoarthritis, hypertension, and coronary artery disease.</p>
                    <p>Patients with affective disorders have increased mortality from infections and from neurological, circulatory, and respiratory disorders.</p>
    
                </div>
              </section>

              <section id='heading-1-2'>
                <header>
                  <h3>
                    <a aria-hidden href='#heading-1-2'>Psychological Reaction to Physical Illness</a>
                  </h3>
                </header>
                <div class='body'>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Patients become emotionally distressed when they develop physical illness during the early stages when the diagnosis and required treatment may not have been clearly defined.</li>
                        <li>Most patients cope emotionally in an adaptive manner, modifying their lifestyle in accordance with the severity of symptoms and the demands of treatments.</li>
                        <li>A significant minority develops recognizable psychiatric disorders‚Äîa mixture of anxiety and depression‚Äîwhich could take the form of an adjustment disorder. This may resolve within a few weeks if the prognosis is recognized as being favorable.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Note:</strong> In some cases, symptoms of anxiety and depression do not resolve even though there may be complete physical recovery. Prolonged anxiety, phobic, or depressive reactions may then develop.</p>
                    
    
                    <h4>Diagnosing Depressive Illness in Physical Illness</h4>
                    <p>Attention should be placed on psychological symptoms such as anhedonia, hopelessness, and suicidal thoughts. Less emphasis should be placed on somatic symptoms such as anorexia, weight loss, and fatigue, all of which might be explained by the underlying physical disease.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Once depressive symptoms are elicited, an assessment of suicidal risk becomes essential.</li>
                        <li>Patients considered to be at high risk will need special care and consideration.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Acute Psychiatric Reaction</h4>
                    <p>A rare complication in people of paranoid disposition. It takes the form of a systemized delusional experience, nearly always with persecutory content, occurring in clear consciousness (consciousness is impaired in delirium).</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Most likely to develop in coronary care or intensive care units.</li>
                        <li>Unfamiliarity with the high technology environment could be responsible.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Symptoms usually resolve if the patient can be transferred to an environment perceived as less threatening.</p>
                    
                    <h4>PTSD</h4>
                    <p>Explore for symptoms of PTSD in patients admitted to the hospital following trauma, such as sleep disturbances, increased arousal, and phobic avoidance.</p>
                    <p>If the stay is brief, the characteristic symptoms may not develop during the admission but may become apparent during the weeks following discharge from the hospital.</p>

                        <li>Circumstances or conditions that could raise suspicion for an underlying physical cause for mood changes are:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Depression present for the first time in middle age or later.</li>
                                <li>There is no understandable psychosocial etiology.</li>
                                <li>There is no family history of mood disorder.</li>
                                <li>The patient has a stable premorbid personality.</li>

                <a aria-hidden href='#heading-2-1'>The Five Stages of Grief</a>
              </h3>
            </header>
            <div class='body'>
                <p>The K√ºbler-Ross model, commonly known as the five stages of grief, was first introduced by Elisabeth K√ºbler-Ross in her 1969 book, "On Death and Dying."</p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Denial:</strong> "I feel fine."; "This can't be happening, not to me." Denial is usually only a temporary defense for the individual. This feeling is generally replaced with heightened awareness of situations and individuals that will be left behind after death.</li>
                    <li><strong>Anger:</strong> "Why me? It's not fair!"; "How can this happen to me?"; "Who is to blame?" Once in the second stage, the individual recognizes that denial cannot continue. Because of anger, the person is very difficult to care for due to misplaced feelings of rage and envy. Any individual that symbolizes life or energy is subject to projected resentment and jealousy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bargaining:</strong> "Just let me live to see my children graduate."; "I'll do anything for a few more years."; "I will give my life savings if..." The third stage involves the hope that the individual can somehow postpone or delay death. Usually, the negotiation for an extended life is made with a higher power in exchange for a reformed lifestyle. Psychologically, the individual is saying, "I understand I will die, but if I could just have more time..."</li>
                    <li><strong>Depression:</strong> "I'm so sad, why bother with anything?"; "I'm going to die... What's the point?"; "I miss my loved one, why go on?" During the fourth stage, the dying person begins to understand the certainty of death. Because of this, the individual may become silent, refuse visitors, and spend much of the time crying and grieving. This process allows the dying person to disconnect oneself from things of love and affection. It is not recommended to attempt to cheer up an individual who is in this stage. It is an important time for grieving that must be processed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Acceptance:</strong> "It's going to be okay."; "I can't fight it, I may as well prepare for it." In this last stage, the individual begins to come to terms with their mortality or that of their loved one.</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>K√ºbler-Ross originally applied these stages to people suffering from terminal illness, later to any form of catastrophic personal loss (job, income, freedom). This may also include significant life events such as the death of a loved one, divorce, drug addiction, the onset of a disease or chronic illness, an infertility diagnosis, as well as many tragedies and disasters.</p>

                <p>K√ºbler-Ross claimed these steps do not necessarily come in the order noted above, nor are all steps experienced by all patients, though she stated a person will always experience at least two. Often, people will experience several stages in a "roller coaster" effect‚Äîswitching between two or more stages, returning to one or more several times before working through it.</p>
                
                <p>Significantly, people experiencing the stages should not force the process. The grief process is highly personal and should not be rushed, nor lengthened, on the basis of an individual's imposed time frame or opinion. One should merely be aware that the stages will be worked through and the ultimate stage of "Acceptance" will be reached.</p>
                
                <p>However, there are individuals who struggle with death until the end. Some psychologists believe that the harder a person fights death, the more likely they are to stay in the denial stage. If this is the case, it is possible the ill person will have more difficulty dying in a dignified way. Other psychologists state that not confronting death until the end is adaptive for some people. Those who experience problems working through the stages should consider professional grief counseling or support groups.</p>

                <a aria-hidden href='#heading-2-2'>Breast Cancer</a>
              </h3>
            </header>
            <div class='body'>
                <p>It can be a life-threatening condition. Women with early breast cancer are made aware of 95-98% 5-year survival rates with treatment.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>This prognostic information may alleviate anxiety in some patients, but the uncertainty of the 2-5% risk to life is almost unbearable.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Coping with uncertainty could be a central psychological issue.</p>

                <h4>Surgical Treatment for Breast Cancer:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lumpectomy</li>
                    <li>Axillary lymph node removal</li>
                    <li>Total mastectomy</li>
                    <li>Various breast reconstruction techniques</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These procedures are mutilating and directly affect body image and psychosexual function. For example, loss of nipple after breast-conserving surgery for Paget's disease removes what may have been an important source of sexual arousal and alters body image.</p>
                
                <h4>Chemotherapy:</h4>
                <p>Usually causes hair loss, fatigue, and vomiting. Fertility is often lost.</p>
                
                <h4>Hormonal Treatment (such as tamoxifen):</h4>
                <p>Provokes an early menopause and causes weight gain and night sweats.</p>

                <p>Overtime, many patients with breast cancer come to see it as a long-term medical condition characterized by persistent lymphedema of the arm, vaginal dryness, weight gain, and frightening annual reviews. It is not straightforward to achieve or resume such social roles as worker, lover, or mother in the face of these experiences.</p>

                <p><strong>Factors that determine how women cope psychologically:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Young women with pre-existing body image problems or histories of negative sexual experiences are particularly distressed.</li>
                    <li>Breast reconstruction gives better psychosexual outcomes than mastectomy alone.</li>
                    <li>Patients with breast cancer and a history of psychiatric disorder experience more psychiatric symptoms of anxiety and depression than those with better premorbid mental health.</li>
                </ul>

                <a aria-hidden href='#heading-2-3'>Head and Neck Cancer</a>
              </h3>
            </header>
            <div class='body'>
                <p>Commonly seen in older men with a long history of smoking and alcohol misuse (alcohol and tobacco act synergistically as carcinogens).</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Male:female ratio = 3:1.</li>
                    <li>Prior to cancer diagnosis, they are socially isolated and have substance dependence. They have premorbid psychosocial problems.</li>
                    <li>Disfigurement and dysfunction are the most prominent problems.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Head and neck cancer and the results of their treatment can be a huge assault on simple pleasures such as eating, tasting, speaking, kissing, breathing, feeling safe alone, and self-worth.</p>
                <p>Chewing, swallowing, or even sealing the lips to prevent drooling of saliva can be impaired.</p>
                <p>Dysarthria is a barrier to social contact, functions as a loss event, and can be an obstacle to any talking treatment to reduce stress.</p>
                <p>Sexual contact, kissing, and even eye-gazing by partners are reduced.</p>
                <p>Anxiety peaks peri-operatively, depression peaks around 3 months post-operatively.</p>
                <p>At 3-year follow-up, 40% of patients with head and neck cancer have depression (much higher than the 9-25% prevalence of depression in patients with cancer generally).</p>

                <p>Head & Neck (& Lung) cancer account for 50% of all deaths by suicide in people with cancer. Risk factors for completed suicide include the following:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Male</li>
                    <li>Older age</li>
                    <li>Living alone</li>
                    <li>Alcohol dependence</li>
                    <li>Poor social network in addition to impaired quality of life caused by the cancer itself</li>
                </ol>
                
                <h4>Cancer Treatment</h4>
                <p>Chemotherapy often causes alopecia and infertility. Infertility and both can be distressing.</p>
                <p>Some patients develop secondary phobia to chemotherapy due to bad experiences with uncontrolled nausea and vomiting after treatment.</p>
                <p>Corticosteroids can cause psychosis, for example. The most severe form will cause some mania symptoms with clouding of consciousness.</p>
                <p>Certain chemotherapy agents, e.g., 5-chlorouracil which causes cerebellar ataxia and delirium, methotrexate can cause delayed leukoencephalopathy, alpha interferon can cause depression, irritability, and impaired intellectual function.</p>

                <p>Radiotherapy causes fatigue and can persist for months after treatment ends.</p>
                
                <h4>Causes of Radiotherapy-Associated Psychiatric Symptoms</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>The use of high dose dexamethasone as an adjunct to radiotherapy of the CNS. Corticosteroids cause elation of mood and psychosis.</li>
                    <li>Radiotherapy of the head, neck, and chest could lead to hypothyroidism due to unavoidable irradiation of the thyroid gland, and this can present with psychiatric symptoms, notably depressive symptoms.</li>
