            <ul>
                <li>Provision of comprehensive mental health services for a well-defined catchment area, demarcated geographically and administratively, such as a borough, district, or county (Farooq and Minhas, 2001).</li>
                <li>In our own context, this will include a state, local government area, ward, etc.</li>

          <ul>
            <li>Dr. Lambo introduced the innovative village system of managing psychiatric patients in 1956.</li>
            <li>Through negotiations, patients were admitted to nearby villages with their accompanying relatives, and daytime nursing care was provided by nurses in these rented apartments for the duration of their treatment.</li>
            <li>Borrofka and Olatawura (1977) reported that, over a period of 50 months, 512 psychiatric patients were treated in the Aro Village therapeutic community.</li>
            <li>The majority of those admitted (94.1%) had symptoms of psychosis, with 57.8% discharged by the end of 3 months, and 88.9% by the end of five months. Of these, 70.3% were judged fit to return to their work.</li>
            <li>The relatives of patients as well as the villagers were involved in the treatment program.</li>

          <h4>Mental Health Service in Nigeria - Summary</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>The bulk of psychiatric services are provided by the 12 (7 federal and 5 states) regional psychiatric hospitals and the departments of psychiatry in 12 medical schools.</li>
            <li>A number of private hospitals, general hospitals, and federal medical centers now provide psychiatric services.</li>
            <li>Evolving Community Mental Health services/programs of state governments and NGOs, e.g., CBM.</li>
            <li>These services are not well-coordinated and are mainly institution-based, with service utilization by community samples of people with disorders less than 10% (Gureje 2006).</li>
            <li>Despite these facilities, mental health care remains inadequate, with the ratio of psychiatric beds being about 0.4 to 10,000 persons (WHO 2001).</li>

          </h2>
        </header>
        <div class='body'>
          <p>It was defined as ‚Äòknowledge and beliefs about mental disorders which aid their recognition, management, or prevention‚Äô. Indeed, mental health literacy is composed of several components, including:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>The ability to recognize specific disorders or types of psychological distress.</li>
            <li>Knowledge and beliefs about risk factors and causes.</li>
            <li>Knowledge and beliefs about self-help interventions.</li>
            <li>Knowledge and beliefs about professional help available.</li>
            <li>Attitudes which facilitate recognition and appropriate help-seeking.</li>
            <li>Knowledge of how to seek mental health information.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>Mental health literacy has been defined to include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Understanding how to obtain and maintain positive mental health.</li>
            <li>Understanding mental disorders and their treatments.</li>
            <li>Decreasing stigma related to mental disorders.</li>
            <li>Enhancing help-seeking efficacy (knowing when and where to seek help and developing competencies designed to improve one‚Äôs mental health care and self-management capabilities).</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h4>Clinical Implications of Mental Health Literacy</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>The public does not share many of the core beliefs of clinicians regarding the treatment and etiology of mental disorders.</li>
            <li>Clinicians may have difficulty implementing evidence-based mental health care if patients do not believe in the interventions offered.</li>
            <li>An increase in mental health literacy in the population may assist prevention, early intervention, effective self-help, and support of others in the community.</li>
            <li>Enhanced understanding of mental health literacy (MHL) and the development of contextually and developmentally appropriate interventions, which are independently evaluated using validated measurements, may be expected to help achieve improvements in both individual and population mental health outcomes in the future.</li>

            <li>Denouncing</li>
          </ol>
          
          <p>Advocacy is an important means of raising awareness on mental health issues and ensuring that mental health is on the national agenda of governments. Advocacy can lead to improvements in policy, legislation, and service development.</p>
          
          <h4>Who Are Those Involved in Advocacy?</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Patients and families</strong></li>
            <ul>
              <li> Patients have played various roles in advocacy, ranging from influencing policies and legislation to providing concrete help for persons with mental disorders. The provision of care for persons with mental disorders is a distinctive role for families, particularly in developing countries.</li>
              <li>In many places, they are the primary care providers and their organizations are fundamental as support networks.</li>
              <li>In addition to providing mutual support and services, many family groups have become advocates, educating the community, increasing the support obtained from policy-makers, denouncing stigma and discrimination, and fighting for improved services.</li>
              <p>Participation in advocacy organizations by patients and families has several positive outcomes:</p>
              
                <li>Improvements in the policies and practices of governments and institutions, changes in laws and government regulations.</li>
                <li>Improvements in the promotion of mental health and the prevention of mental disorders, protection and promotion of the rights and interests of persons with mental disorders and their families, and improvements in mental health services, treatment, and care among others.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>Nongovernmental Organizations (NGOs)</strong></li>
            <p>Nongovernmental organizations involving mental health professionals or people from diverse fields fulfill many of the advocacy roles described for patients and families. Their distinctive contribution to the advocacy movement is that they support and empower patients and families.</p>
            <p>Examples of such organizations include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>SURPIN</li>
              <li>MANI</li>
              <li>MIND READERS ACADEMY</li>
              <li>MINDFULLY YOURS</li>
              <li>ASIDO FOUNDATION</li>
            </ul>
                        
            <li> <strong>Mental Health Workers</strong></li>
            <ul>
              <li>Mental health workers and general health workers have taken a more active role in protecting patients‚Äô rights and raising awareness for improved services, especially as care has been shifted from psychiatric hospitals to community services.</li>
              <li>Some specific advocacy roles for mental health workers relate to:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Clinical work from a patient and family perspective</li>
                <li>Planning and participation in the activities of patients and family groups</li>
              </ul>
            </ul>
            <li>Policy-makers and Planners </li>
            <ul>
              <li>Policy-makers and planners in the ministries of health play an important role in advocacy, either by:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Direct actions to influence the mental health of populations</li>
                <li>Working indirectly through supporting advocacy groups (patients, families, nongovernmental organizations, mental health workers)</li>
              </ul>
              <li>Convincing other policy-makers and planners, such as:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>The executive branch of government</li>
                <li>The ministry of finance and other ministries</li>
                <li>The judiciary</li>
                <li>The legislature and political parties</li>
              </ul>
              <li>To focus on and invest in mental health.</li>
            </ul>
            
          </ul>

          <h4>Proposed Advocacy Plans</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Making brief documents identifying the priority areas in mental health.</li>
            <li>Identifying one or two psychiatric services with the best practices in the country and negotiating a joint demonstration project. This should involve the ministry of health and the psychiatric services. It should have the goal of forming consumer groups and/or family groups with advocacy functions. Technical support and funding are necessary.</li>

            <li>Identify and collaborate with one or two stakeholder groups interested in the rights of people with mental disorders.</li>
            <li>Empower the advocacy groups by providing them with information, training, and funding, focusing on consumer organizations.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Collaborate with government agencies for formulating the plans.</li>
              <li>Conduct campaigns, for example, using radio and leaflets, to inform the population about the advocacy group.</li>

            <li>A stamp, label, or mark that sets a person apart from others, connects the person to undesirable factors, and leads to rejecting the person. (Ottman et al., 2001).</li>
            <li>Stigma is a strong barrier to the reintegration of psychiatric patients into society/community (Vezzoli et al., 2001).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Described on three conceptual levels:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Cognitive,</li>
            <li>Emotional, and</li>
            <li>Behavioral,</li>
          </ul>
          <p>which allows us to separate mere stereotypes from prejudice and discrimination.</p>
          
          <h4>STEREOTYPES</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Perceptions, beliefs, and expectations a person has about members of a particular group.</li>
            <li>Prominent stereotypes surrounding the mentally ill presume dangerousness, unpredictability, and unreliability.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h4>PREJUDICE</h4>
          <p>A negative attitude toward an individual or entire category of people based simply on identifying with a particular group.</p>
          
          <h4>DISCRIMINATION</h4>
          <p>Negative differential treatment of individuals who belong to a different group, or are perceived as different, or a minority group.</p>
          

          <h4>STIGMA: Types</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Public/Social stigma:</strong> Involves the negative or discriminatory attitudes that others have about mental illness.</li>
            <li><strong>Self-stigma:</strong> Refers to the negative attitudes, including internalized shame, that people with mental illness have about their own condition.</li>
            <li><strong>Institutional/Systemic stigma:</strong> Involves policies of government and private organizations that intentionally or unintentionally limit opportunities for people with mental illness. Examples include lower funding for mental illness research or fewer mental health services relative to other health care.</li>
            <li><strong>Experienced stigma:</strong> Refers to the actual encounter with stigmatizing attitudes and behavior from the general population.</li>
            <li><strong>Anticipatory/Perceived stigma:</strong> Refers to the beliefs and expectations that people with mental illness have about the general population's stigmatizing attitudes toward themselves.</li>

            <li><strong>Professional stigma/healthcare stigma:</strong> Occurs in any healthcare setting where a patient is judged based on their mental health condition for unrelated causes.</li>
            <li><strong>Double stigma:</strong> Two highly stigmatized conditions sensitive to cultural themes occur in the same individual. Example: schizophrenia and epilepsy.</li>
            <li><strong>Stigma by association/courtesy stigma:</strong> Involves public disapproval evoked as a consequence of associating with stigmatized persons.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h4>CONSEQUENCES OF STIGMA</h4>

          <p>This can be further discussed using the biopsychosocial approach.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Biological</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Psychological</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Sociological</strong></li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Biological</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Worsening of other pre-existing conditions.</li>
            <li>Double morbidity.</li>
            <li>Mortality.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h4>Psychosocial Causes</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Reduced hope.</li>
            <li>Lower self-esteem.</li>
            <li>Increased psychiatric symptoms.</li>
            <li>Difficulties with social relationships.</li>
            <li>Reduced likelihood of staying with treatment.</li>
            <li>More difficulties at work.</li>

            <li>Reluctance to seek help or treatment and less likely to stay with treatment.</li>
            <li>Social isolation/Exclusion.</li>
            <li>Lack of understanding by family, friends, coworkers, or others.</li>
            <li>Fewer opportunities for work, school, or social activities or trouble finding housing.</li>
            <li>Human rights violation (Bullying, physical violence, or harassment).</li>
            <li>Health insurance that doesn't adequately cover treatment for mental illnesses.</li>
            <li>The belief that a person with mental illness will never succeed at certain challenges or can't improve their situation.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h4>Steps in Curtailing Stigma</h4>
          <p>Approaches to changing stigma have been divided into three paradigms (Corrigan et al., 2012):</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Education</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Contact</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Protest</strong></li>
          </ul>
          
          <h4>Education</h4>

          <p>Educational approaches to stigma challenge inaccurate stereotypes about mental illnesses, replacing them with factual information.</p>
          <p>Examples include public service announcements, books, flyers, movies, videos, web pages, podcasts, virtual reality, and other audiovisual aids.</p>
          <h4>Contact</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Individuals of the general population who meet and interact with people with mental illnesses are likely to lessen their levels of prejudice.</li>
            <li>It must be targeted and continuous. Employers, landlords, healthcare providers, legislators, and media outlets.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h4>Protest</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Protest/social activism highlights the injustices of various forms of stigma and chastises offenders for their stereotypes and discrimination.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h4>Build an Instinct Toward Person-First Language</h4>
