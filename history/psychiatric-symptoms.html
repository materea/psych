          <h4>Agitation</h4>
          <p>See Psychomotor Agitation.</p>
          
          <h4>Agoraphobia</h4>
          <p>A generalized phobia in which there is a fear of open spaces, social situations, crowds, etc. Associated with avoidance of these stimuli.</p>

          <h4>Akathisia</h4>
          <p>A subjective sense of uncomfortable desire to move, relieved by repeated movement of the affected part (usually the legs). A side effect of treatment with neuroleptic drugs.</p>
          
          <h4>Alexithymia</h4>
          <p>Inability to describe one‚Äôs subjective emotional experiences verbally. May be a personality characteristic but is also associated with somatization.</p>
          
          <h4>Alogia</h4>
          <p>Poverty of thoughts, as observed by the absence of spontaneous speech. A negative symptom of schizophrenia and a symptom of depressive illness.</p>

          <h4>Amnesia</h4>
          <p>Loss of ability to recall memories for a period of time. May be global (complete memory loss for the time period) or partial (patchy memory loss with ‚Äòislands‚Äô of preserved memory).</p>

          <h4>Anorexia</h4>
          <p>Loss of appetite for food. Seen in depressive illness and many general medical conditions. Interestingly, patients with anorexia nervosa often do not have anorexia as so defined. They commonly describe themselves as very hungry‚Äî controlling their desire for food by supreme effort in order to control their weight.</p>
          
          <h4>Anterograde Amnesia</h4>
          <p>The period of amnesia between an event (e.g., head injury) and the resumption of continuous memory. The length of anterograde amnesia is correlated with the extent of brain injury.</p>
          
          <h4>Anxiety</h4>
          <p>A normal and adaptive response to stress and danger which is pathological if prolonged, severe, or out of keeping with the real threat of the external situation. Anxiety has two components: psychic anxiety, which is an affect characterized by arousal, apprehension, a sense of vulnerability, and dysphoria; and somatic anxiety in which there are bodily sensations of palpitations, sweating, dyspnea, pallor, and abdominal discomfort.</p>
          
          <h4>Aphonia</h4>
          <p>Loss of the ability to vocalize. May occur with structural disease affecting the vocal cords directly, the ninth cranial nerve, or higher centres. May also occur in functional illness where the underlying vocal cord function is normal. This can be demonstrated by asking the patient to cough‚Äî a normal cough demonstrates the ability of the vocal cords to oppose normally.</p>
          
          <h4>Asyndesis</h4>
          <p>Synonym for loosening of associations.</p>

          <p>Episode of disturbed sensation occurring before an epileptic event. Wide range of manifestations, although usually stereotyped for each individual.</p>
          
          <h4>Autistic Thinking</h4>
          <p>An abnormal absorption with the self, distinguished by interpersonal communication difficulties, a short attention span, and an inability to relate to others as people.</p>
          
          <h4>Autochthonous Delusion</h4>
          <p>A primary delusion that appears to arise fully formed in the patient‚Äôs mind without explanation (e.g., a patient suddenly becomes aware that he has inherited a large estate in the Scottish Highlands and will thus have the funds to settle scores with all those who have ever wronged him).</p>
          
          <h4>Automatic Obedience</h4>
          <p>A motor symptom of schizophrenia in which the patient obeys the examiner‚Äôs instructions unquestioningly. This cooperation may be ‚Äòexcessive‚Äô, with the patient going beyond what is asked (e.g., raising both arms and both legs when asked to raise an arm).</p>
          
          <h4>Automatism</h4>
          <p>Behaviour which is apparently conscious in nature, occurring in the absence of full consciousness (e.g., during a temporal lobe seizure).</p>

          
          <h4>Autoscopy</h4>
          <p>The experience of seeing a visual hallucination or pseudohallucination of oneself. Also known as ‚Äòphantom mirror image‚Äô. Uncommon symptom reported in schizophrenia and temporal lobe epilepsy.</p>
          
          <h4>Autotopagnosia</h4>
          <p>Condition where one cannot identify or describe their own body parts. Individuals can dress and move appropriately but cannot talk about their bodies.</p>
          
          <h4>Avoidance</h4>
          <p>The action of not exposing oneself to situations which generate anxiety, e.g., a patient with agoraphobia remaining at home or a patient with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), following a road traffic accident, refusing to drive. Can be understood in terms of an operant conditioning model where actions with reward‚Äî in this case, reduction of anxiety‚Äî are repeated.</p>

          <h4>Belle Indiff√©rence</h4>
          <p>A surprising lack of concern for, or denial of, apparently severe functional disability. It is part of classical descriptions of hysteria and continues to be associated with operational descriptions of conversion disorder. It is also seen in medical illnesses (e.g., following a cerebrovascular accident) and is a rare and non-specific symptom of no diagnostic value.</p>
          
          <h4>Biological Features of Depression</h4>
          <p>Symptoms of moderate to severe depressive illness which reflect disturbance of core vegetative function. They are depressive sleep disturbance, anorexia, loss of libido, anergia, and subjective impression of deterioration in memory and concentration.</p>
          
          <h4>Blunting of Affect</h4>
          <p>Loss of the normal degree of emotional sensitivity and sense of appropriate emotional response to events. A negative symptom of schizophrenia.</p>

          <h4>Capgras Syndrome</h4>
          <p>A type of delusional misidentification in which the patient believes that a person known to them has been replaced by a ‚Äòdouble‚Äô who is to all external appearances identical but is not the ‚Äòreal person‚Äô.</p>
          
          <h4>Catalepsy</h4>
          <p>A rare motor symptom of schizophrenia. Describes a situation in which the patient‚Äôs limbs can be passively moved to any posture, which will then be held for a prolonged period of time. Also known as waxy flexibility or flexibilitas cerea. See also Psychological pillow.</p>
          
          <h4>Cataplexy</h4>
          <p>Symptom of narcolepsy in which there is sudden loss of muscle tone, leading to collapse. Usually occurs following emotional stress.</p>
          
          <h4>Catastrophic Reaction</h4>
          <p>Response occasionally seen in patients with dementia who are asked to perform tasks beyond their, now impaired, performance level. There is sudden agitation, anger, and occasionally violence.</p>
          
          <h4>Catatonia</h4>
          <p>Resting muscle tone which is not present on active or passive movement (in contrast to the rigidity associated with Parkinson‚Äôs disease and extra-pyramidal side effects). A motor symptom of schizophrenia.</p>
          
          <h4>Chorea</h4>
          <p>Sudden and involuntary movement of several muscle groups, with the resultant action appearing like part of a voluntary movement.</p>
          
          <h4>Circumstantial Thinking</h4>
          <p>A disorder of the form of thought where irrelevant details and digressions overwhelm the direction of the thought process. This abnormality may be reflected in the resultant speech. It is seen in mania and in anankastic personality disorder.</p>
          
          <h4>Clang Association</h4>
          <p>An abnormality of speech where the connection between words is their sound, rather than their meaning. May occur during manic flight of ideas.</p>
          
          <h4>Clouding of Consciousness</h4>
          <p>Conscious level between full consciousness and coma. Covers a range of increasingly severe loss of function with drowsiness and impairment of concentration and perception.</p>
          
          <h4>Command Hallucination</h4>
          <p>An auditory hallucination of a commanding voice, instructing the patient towards a particular action. Also known as teleological hallucination.</p>
          
          <h4>Completion Illusion</h4>
          <p>See Illusion.</p>
          
          <h4>Compulsion</h4>
          <p>A behavior or action which is recognized by the patient as unnecessary and purposeless, but which he cannot resist performing repeatedly (e.g., hand washing). The drive to perform the action is recognized by the patient as his own (i.e., there is no sense of ‚Äòpossession‚Äô or passivity), but it is associated with a subjective sense of need to perform the act, often to avoid the occurrence of an adverse event. The patient may resist carrying out the action for a time, at the expense of mounting anxiety.</p>

          <h4>Concrete Thinking</h4>
          <p>The loss of the ability to understand abstract concepts and metaphorical ideas, leading to a strictly literal form of speech and the inability to comprehend allusive language. Seen in schizophrenia and dementing illnesses.</p>
          
          <h4>Confabulation</h4>
          <p>The process of describing plausibly false memories for a period for which the patient has amnesia. Occurs in Korsakoff‚Äôs syndrome, in dementing illnesses, and following alcoholic palimpsest.</p>
          
          <h4>Confusion</h4>
          <p>The core symptom of delirium or acute confusional state. There is disorientation, clouding of consciousness, and deterioration in the ability to think rationally, lay down new memories, and understand sensory input.</p>
          
          <h4>Conversion</h4>
          <p>Development of features suggestive of physical illness but which are attributed to psychiatric illness or emotional disturbance, rather than organic pathology. Originally described in terms of psychoanalytic theory where the presumed mechanism was ‚Äòconversion‚Äô of unconscious distress to physical symptoms, rather than allowing its expression in conscious thought.</p>
          
          <h4>Coprolalia</h4>
          <p>A ‚Äòforced‚Äô vocalization of obscene words or phrases. The symptom is largely involuntary but can be resisted for a time, at the expense of mounting anxiety. Seen in Gilles de la Tourette‚Äôs syndrome.</p>
          
          <h4>Cotard Syndrome</h4>
          <p>A presentation of psychotic depressive illness seen particularly in elderly people. There is a combination of severely depressed mood with nihilistic delusions and/or hypochondriacal delusions. The patient may state that he is already dead and should be buried, that his insides have stopped working and are rotting away, or that he has stopped existing altogether.</p>
          
          <h4>Couvade Syndrome</h4>
          <p>A conversion symptom seen in partners of expectant mothers during their pregnancy. The symptoms vary but mimic pregnancy symptoms and so include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and food cravings. It is not delusional in nature; the affected individual does not believe they are pregnant (cf. pseudocyesis). This behavior is a cultural norm in some societies.</p>
          
          <h4>Craving</h4>
          <p>A subjective sense of the need to consume a particular substance (e.g., drugs or alcohol) for which there may be dependence.</p>
          
          <h4>Cyclothymia</h4>
          <p>A personality characteristic in which there is cyclical mood variation, to a lesser degree than in bipolar disorder.</p>

          <h4>De Cl√©rambault Syndrome</h4>
          <p>A form of delusion of love. The patient, usually female, believes that another, higher-status individual is in love with them. There may be an additional persecutory delusional component where the affected individual comes to believe that individuals are conspiring to keep them apart. The object may be an employer or a doctor or, in some cases, a prominent public figure or celebrity.</p>
          
          <h4>D√©j√† vu</h4>
          <p>A sense that events being experienced for the first time have been experienced before. An everyday experience, but also a non-specific symptom of a number of disorders, including temporal lobe epilepsy, schizophrenia, and anxiety disorders.</p>
          
          <h4>Delirium</h4>
          <p>A clinical syndrome of confusion, variable degree of clouding of consciousness, visual illusions, and/or visual hallucinations, lability of affect, and disorientation. The clinical features can vary markedly in severity, hour by hour. Delirium is a stereotyped response by the brain to a variety of insults and is similar in presentation, whatever the primary cause.</p>
          
          <h4>Delirium Tremens</h4>
          <p>The clinical picture of acute confusional state secondary to alcohol withdrawal. Comprises confusion, withdrawals, visual hallucinations, and occasionally persecutory delusions and Lilliputian hallucinations.</p>
          
          <h4>Delusion</h4>
          <p>An abnormal belief which is held with absolute subjective certainty, requires no external proof, may be held in the face of contradictory evidence, and has personal significance and importance to the individual concerned. Excluded are beliefs understood as part of the subject‚Äôs cultural or religious background. While the content is usually demonstrably false and bizarre in nature, this is not invariably so.</p>
          
          <p><em>Primary delusions</em> are the direct result of psychopathology, while secondary delusions can be understood as having arisen in response to other primary psychiatric conditions (e.g., a patient with severely depressed mood developing delusions of poverty or a patient with progressive memory impairment developing a delusion that people are entering his house and stealing or moving items). Primary delusions can be subdivided by the method by which they are perceived as having arisen or into broad classes based on their content.</p>
          
          <p>If the patient is asked to recall the point when they became aware of the delusion and its significance to them, they may report that the belief arose: ‚Äòout of the blue‚Äô (autochthonous delusion), on seeing a normal percept (delusional perception), on recalling a memory (delusional memory), or on a background of anticipation, odd experiences, and awareness (delusional mood).</p>
          
          <p>Based on their content, 12 types of primary delusion are commonly recognized: </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Persecutory</li>
            <li>Grandiose</li>
            <li>Delusions of control</li>
            <li>Delusions of thought interference</li>
            <li>Delusions of reference</li>
            <li>Delusions of guilt</li>
            <li>Delusions of love</li>
            <li>Delusional misidentification</li>
            <li>Jealousy</li>
            <li>Hypochondriacal delusions</li>
            <li>Nihilistic delusions</li>
            <li>Delusions of infestation</li>
          </ol>
          
          <h4>Delusional Atmosphere</h4>
          <p>Synonym for delusional mood.</p>
          
          <h4>Delusional Elaboration</h4>
          <p>Secondary delusions which arise in a manner that is understandable as the patient attempting to find explanations for primary psychopathological processes (e.g., a patient with persistent auditory hallucinations developing a belief that a transmitter has been placed in their ear).</p>
          
          <h4>Delusional Jealousy</h4>
          <p>A delusional belief that one‚Äôs partner is being unfaithful. This can occur as part of a wider psychotic illness, secondary to organic brain damage (e.g., following the ‚Äòpunch-drunk syndrome‚Äô in boxers), associated with alcohol dependence, or as a monosymptomatic delusional disorder (‚ÄòOthello syndrome‚Äô). Whatever the primary cause, there is a strong association with violence, usually towards the supposedly unfaithful partner. For this type of delusion, the content is not bizarre or inconceivable, and the central belief may even be true.</p>
          
          <h4>Delusional Memory</h4>
          <p>A primary delusion which is recalled as arising as a result of a memory (e.g., a patient who remembers his parents taking him to hospital for an operation as a child becoming convinced that he had been implanted with control and monitoring devices which have become active in his adult life).</p>
          
          <h4>Delusional Misidentification</h4>
          <p>A delusional belief that certain individuals are not who they externally appear to be. The delusion may be that familiar people have been replaced with outwardly identical strangers (Capgras syndrome) or that strangers are ‚Äòreally‚Äô familiar people (Fr√©goli syndrome). A rare symptom of schizophrenia or of other psychotic illnesses.</p>
          
          <h4>Delusional Mood</h4>
          <p>A primary delusion which is recalled as arising following a period when there is an abnormal mood state characterized by anticipatory anxiety, a sense of ‚Äòsomething about to happen‚Äô, and an increased sense of the significance of minor events. The development of the formed delusion may come as a relief to the patient in this situation.</p>
          
          <h4>Delusional Perception</h4>
          <p>A primary delusion which is recalled as having arisen as a result of a perception (e.g., a patient who, on seeing two white cars pull up in front of his house, became convinced that he was therefore about to be wrongly accused of being a paedophile). The percept is a real external object, not a hallucinatory experience.</p>
          
          <h4>Delusions of Control</h4>
          <p>A group of delusions which are also known as passivity phenomena or delusions of bodily passivity. They are considered first-rank symptoms of schizophrenia. The core feature is the delusional belief that one is no longer in sole control of one‚Äôs own body. The individual delusions are that one is being forced by some external agent to feel emotions, to desire to do things, to perform actions, or to experience bodily sensations. Respectively, these delusions are called: passivity of affect, passivity of impulse, passivity of volition, and somatic passivity.</p>
          

          <h4>Delusions of Guilt</h4>
          <p>A delusional belief that one has committed a crime or other reprehensible act. A feature of psychotic depressive illness (e.g., an elderly woman with severe depressive illness who becomes convinced that her child, who died by cot death many years before, was, in fact, murdered by her).</p>
          
          <h4>Delusions of Infestation</h4>
          <p>A delusional belief that one‚Äôs skin is infested with multiple tiny, mite-like animals. As a monosymptomatic delusional disorder, this is called Ekbom syndrome. It is also seen in acute confusional states (particularly secondary to drug or alcohol withdrawal), in schizophrenia, in dementing illnesses, and as delusional elaboration of tactile hallucinatory experiences.</p>
          
          <h4>Delusions of Love</h4>
          <p>A delusion where the patient believes another individual is in love with them and that they are destined to be together. A rare symptom of schizophrenia and other psychotic illnesses‚Äî one particular subtype of this delusion is de Cl√©rambault syndrome.</p>
          
          <h4>Delusions of Reference</h4>
          <p>A delusional belief that external events or situations have been arranged in such a way as to have particular significance for, or to convey a message to, the affected individual. The patient may believe that television news items are referring to them or that parts of the Bible are about them directly.</p>
          
          <h4>Delusions of Thought Interference</h4>
          <p>A group of delusions considered first-rank symptoms of schizophrenia. They include thought insertion, thought withdrawal, and thought broadcasting.</p>
          
          <h4>Dementia</h4>
          <p>Chronic brain failure‚Äî in contrast with delirium (which is acute brain failure). In dementia, there is progressive and global loss of brain function. It is usually irreversible. Different dementing illnesses will show different patterns and rates of functional loss, but in general, there is impairment of memory, loss of higher cognitive function, perceptual abnormalities, dyspraxia, and disintegration of the personality.</p>
          
          <h4>Dependence</h4>
          <p>The inability to control the intake of a substance to which one is addicted. The dependence syndrome is characterized by primacy of drug-seeking behavior, the inability to control the intake of a substance once consumption has started, use of the substance to avoid withdrawals, tolerance to the intoxicating effects of the substance, and re-instigation of the pattern of use after a period of abstinence. Dependence has two components: psychological dependence, which is the subjective feeling of loss of control, cravings, and preoccupation with obtaining the substance; and physiological dependence, which is the physical consequences of withdrawal and is specific to each drug. For some drugs (e.g. alcohol), both psychological and physiological dependence occur; for others (e.g. LSD), there are no marked features of physiological dependence.</p>
          
          <h4>Depersonalization</h4>
          <p>An unpleasant subjective experience where the patient feels as if they have become ‚Äòunreal‚Äô. A non-specific symptom occurring in many psychiatric disorders, as well as in normal people.</p>
          
          <h4>Depressed Mood</h4>
          <p>The core feature of depressive illness. Milder forms of depressed mood are part of the human experience, but in its pathological form, it is a subjective experience. Patients describe variously: an unremitting and pervasive unhappiness; a loss of the ability to experience the normal range of positive emotions ('feeling of a lack of feeling'); a sense of hopelessness and negative thoughts about themselves, their situation, and the future; somatic sensations of 'a weight' pressing down on the head and body; and a sort of 'psychic pain' or wound.</p>
          
          <h4>Depressive Sleep Disturbance</h4>
          <p>Characteristic pattern of sleep disturbance seen in depressive illness. It includes initial insomnia and early morning waking. In addition, sleep is described as more shallow, broken, and less refreshing. There is increased rapid eye movement (REM) latency where the patient enters REM sleep more rapidly than normal, and REM sleep is concentrated in the beginning, rather than the end, of the sleep period.</p>
          
          <h4>Derailment</h4>
          <p>A symptom of schizophrenic thought disorder in which there is a total break in the chain of association between the meaning of thoughts. The connection between two sequential ideas is apparent neither to the patient nor to the examiner.</p>
          
          <h4>Derealization</h4>
          <p>An unpleasant subjective experience where the patient feels as if the world has become unreal. Like depersonalization, it is a non-specific symptom of a number of disorders.</p>
          
          <h4>Diogenes Syndrome</h4>
          <p>Hoarding of objects, usually of no practical use, and neglect of one‚Äôs home or environment. May be a behavioral manifestation of an organic disorder, schizophrenia, a depressive disorder, or OCD; or may reflect a reaction late in life to stress in a certain type of personality.</p>
          
          <h4>Disinhibition</h4>
          <p>Loss of the normal sense of which behaviors are appropriate in the current social setting. Symptom of manic illnesses and occurs in the later stages of dementing illnesses and during intoxication with drugs or alcohol.</p>
          
          <h4>Disorientation</h4>
          <p>Loss of the ability to recall and accurately update information as to the current time, place, and personal identity. Occurs in delirium and dementia. With increasing severity of illness, orientation for time is lost first, then orientation for place, with orientation for person usually preserved until dysfunction becomes very severe.</p>
          
          <h4>Dissociation</h4>
          <p>The separation of unpleasant emotions and memories from consciousness awareness, with subsequent disruption to the normal integrated function of consciousness and memory. Conversion and dissociation are related concepts. In conversion, the emotional abnormality produces physical symptoms, while in dissociation, there is impairment of mental functioning (e.g., in dissociative fugue and dissociative amnesia).</p>
          
          <h4>Distractibility</h4>
          <p>Inability to maintain attention or loss of vigilance on minimal distracting stimulation.</p>
          
          <h4>Diurnal Variation</h4>
          <p>Variation in the severity of a symptom, depending on the time of day (e.g., depressed mood experienced as most severe in the morning and improving later in the day).</p>
          
          <h4>Double Depression</h4>
          <p>A combination of dysthymia and depressive illness.</p>
          
          <h4>Dysarthria</h4>
          <p>Impairment in the ability to properly articulate speech. Caused by lesions in the brainstem, cranial nerves, or pharynx. Distinguished from dysphasia in that there is no impairment of comprehension, writing, or higher language function.</p>
          
          <h4>Dyskinesia</h4>
          <p>Impairment of voluntary motor activity by superimposed involuntary motor activity.</p>
          
          <h4>Dyslexia</h4>
          <p>Inability to read at a level normal for one‚Äôs age or intelligence level.</p>
          
          <h4>Dysmorphophobia</h4>
          <p>A type of over-valued idea where the patient believes one aspect of his body is abnormal or conspicuously deformed.</p>
          
          <h4>Dysphasia</h4>
          <p>Impairment in producing or understanding speech (expressive dysphasia and receptive dysphasia, respectively) related to cortical abnormality, in contrast with dysarthria where the abnormality is in the organs of speech production.</p>
          
          <h4>Dysphoria</h4>
          <p>An emotional state experienced as unpleasant. Secondary to a number of symptoms (e.g., depressed mood, withdrawals).</p>
          
          <h4>Dyspraxia</h4>
          <p>Inability to carry out complex motor tasks (e.g., dressing, eating), although the component motor movements are preserved.</p>
          
          <h4>Dysthymia</h4>
          <p>Chronic, mildly depressed mood and diminished enjoyment, not severe enough to be considered depressive illness.</p>

              <h4>Echopraxia</h4>
              <p>Motor symptom of schizophrenia in which the patient mirrors the doctor‚Äôs body movements. This continues after being told to stop.</p>

              <h4>Eidetic Imagery</h4>
              <p>Particular type of exceptionally vivid visual memory. Not a hallucination. More common in children than adults (cf. flashbacks).</p>

              <h4>Ekbom Syndrome</h4>
              <p>A monosymptomatic delusional disorder where the core delusion is a delusion of infestation.</p>

              <h4>Elation</h4>
              <p>Severe and prolonged elevation of mood. A feature of manic illnesses.</p>

              <h4>Elemental Hallucination</h4>
              <p>A type of hallucination where the false perceptions are of very simple form (e.g., flashes of light or clicks and bangs). Associated with organic illness.</p>

              <h4>Elevation of Mood</h4>
              <p>The core feature of manic illnesses. The mood is preternaturally cheerful; the patient may describe feeling ‚Äòhigh‚Äô, and there is subjectively increased speed and ease of thinking.</p>

<h4>Expressive Dysphasia</h4>
<p>Dysphasia affecting the production of speech. There is impairment of word-finding, sentence construction, and articulation. Speech is slow and ‚Äòtelegraphic‚Äô, with substitutions, null words, and perseveration. The patient characteristically exhibits considerable frustration at his deficits. Writing is similarly affected. Basic comprehension is largely intact, and emotional utterances and rote-learnt material may also be surprisingly preserved.</p>

<h4>Extracampine Hallucination</h4>
<p>A hallucination where the percept appears to come from beyond the area usually covered by the senses (e.g., a patient in Edinburgh ‚Äòhearing‚Äô voices seeming to come from a house in Glasgow).</p>

<h4>Extra-Pyramidal Side Effects (EPSEs)</h4>
<p>Side effects of rigidity, tremor, and dyskinesia caused by the anti-dopaminergic effects of psychotropic drugs, particularly neuroleptics. Unlike in idiopathic Parkinson‚Äôs disease, bradykinesia is not prominent.</p>

<p>Internal perceptions which do not have a corresponding object in the external or ‚Äòreal‚Äô world. Includes hallucinations and pseudo-hallucinations.</p>

<h4>Faseln</h4>
<p>Synonym for muddling.</p>

<h4>First-Rank Symptoms (of schizophrenia)</h4>
<p>A group of symptoms, originally described by Schneider, which are useful in the diagnosis of schizophrenia. They are neither pathognomonic for, nor specific to, schizophrenia and are also seen in organic and affective psychoses. There are 11 symptoms in four categories:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Auditory hallucinations
    <ul>
      <li>‚ÄòVoices heard arguing‚Äô.</li>
      <li>Thought echo.</li>
      <li>‚ÄòRunning commentary‚Äô.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>Delusions of thought interference
    <ul>
      <li>Thought insertion.</li>
      <li>Thought withdrawal.</li>
      <li>Thought broadcasting.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>Delusions of control
    <ul>
      <li>Passivity of affect.</li>
      <li>Passivity of impulse.</li>
      <li>Passivity of volitions.</li>
      <li>Somatic passivity.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>Delusional perception
    <ul>
      <li>A primary delusion of any content that is reported by the patient as having arisen following the experience of a normal perception.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Flashbacks</h4>
<p>Exceptionally vivid and affect-laden re-experiencing of remembered experiences. Flashbacks of the initial traumatic event occur in PTSD, and flashbacks of abnormal perceptual experiences initially experienced during LSD intoxication can occur many years after the event.</p>


<h4>Flattening of Affect</h4>
<p>Diminution of the normal range of emotional experience. A negative symptom of schizophrenia.</p>

<h4>Flexibilitas Cerea</h4>
<p>Synonym for catalepsy.</p>

<h4>Flight of Ideas</h4>
<p>Subjective experience of one‚Äôs thoughts being more rapid than normal, with each thought having a greater range of consequent thoughts than normal. Meaningful connections between thoughts are maintained.</p>

<h4>Folie √† Deux</h4>
<p>Describes a situation where two people with a close relationship share a delusional belief. This arises as a result of a psychotic illness in one individual with the development of a delusional belief, which comes to be shared by the second. The delusion resolves in the second person on separation; the first should be assessed and treated in the usual way.</p>

<h4>Formal Thought Disorder</h4>
<p>A term which is confusingly used for three different groups of psychiatric symptoms:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To refer to all pathological disturbances in the form of thought.</li>
  <li>As a synonym for schizophrenic thought disorder.</li>
  <li>To mean the group of first-rank symptoms which are delusions regarding thought interference (i.e. thought insertion, thought withdrawal, and thought broadcasting).</li>
</ul>
<p>The first of these uses is to be preferred.</p>

<h4>Formication</h4>
<p>A form of tactile hallucination in which there is the sensation of numerous insects crawling over the surface of the body. Occurs in alcohol or drug withdrawal, particularly from cocaine.</p>

<h4>Free-floating Anxiety</h4>
<p>Anxiety occurring without any identifiable external stimulus or threat (cf. Phobia).</p>

<h4>Fr√©goli Syndrome</h4>
<p>A type of delusional misidentification, in which the patient believes that strangers have been replaced with familiar people.</p>

<h4>Fugue</h4>
<p>A dissociative reaction to unbearable stress. Following a severe external stressor (e.g. marital break-up), the affected individual develops global amnesia and may wander to a distant location. Consciousness is unimpaired. Following resolution, there is amnesia for the events which occurred during the fugue.</p>

<h4>Functional Hallucination</h4>
<p>A hallucination experienced only when experiencing a normal percept in that modality (e.g. hearing voices when the noise of an air conditioner is heard).</p>

<h4>Fusion</h4>
<p>A symptom of schizophrenic thought disorder, in which two or more unrelated concepts are brought together to form one compound idea.</p>

<h4>Ganser Symptom</h4>
<p>The production of ‚Äòapproximate answers‚Äô. Here the patient gives repeated wrong answers to questions, which are nonetheless ‚Äòin the right ballpark‚Äô (e.g. ‚Äòwhat is the capital of Scotland?‚Äô‚Äî ‚ÄòParis‚Äô). Occasionally associated with organic brain illness, it is much more commonly seen as a form of malingering in those attempting to feign mental illness (e.g. in prisoners awaiting trial).</p>

<h4>Gedankenlautwerden</h4>
<p>Synonym for thought echo.</p>

<h4>Globus Hystericus</h4>
<p>The sensation of a ‚Äòlump in the throat‚Äô occurring without an oesophageal structural abnormality or motility problems. A symptom of anxiety and somatization disorders.</p>

<h4>Glossolalia</h4>
<p>‚ÄòSpeaking in tongues‚Äô. Production of non-speech sounds as a substitute for speech. Seen in dissociative and neurotic disorders and accepted as a subcultural phenomenon in some religious groups.</p>

<h4>Grandiose Delusion</h4>
<p>A delusional belief that one has special powers or is unusually rich or powerful, or that one has an exceptional destiny (e.g. a man who requested admission to hospital because he had become convinced that God had granted him ‚Äòthe greatest possible sort of mind‚Äô and that coming into contact with him would cure others of mental illnesses). Can occur in all psychotic illnesses, but particularly in manic illnesses.</p>

<h4>Grandiosity</h4>
<p>An exaggerated sense of one‚Äôs own importance or abilities. Seen in manic illnesses.</p>

          <h4>Hallucination</h4>
          <p>An internal percept without a corresponding external object. The subjective experience of hallucination is that of experiencing a normal percept in that modality of sensation. A true hallucination will be perceived as in external space, distinct from imagined images, outside conscious control, and as possessing relative permanence. A pseudohallucination will lack one or all of these characteristics.</p>
          
          <p>Hallucinations are subdivided, according to their modality of sensation, and may be auditory, visual, gustatory, tactile, olfactory, or kinaesthetic. Auditory hallucinations, particularly of voices, are characteristic of schizophrenic illness, while visual hallucinations are characteristic of organic states.</p>

          <h4>Hemiballismus</h4>
          <p>Involuntary, large-scale ‚Äòthrowing‚Äô movements of one limb or one body side.</p>
          
          <h4>Hypersomnia</h4>
          <p>Excessive sleepiness with increased length of nocturnal sleep and daytime napping. Occurs as a core feature of narcolepsy and in atypical depressive states.</p>
          
          <h4>Hypnagogic Hallucination</h4>
          <p>A transient false perception experienced while on the verge of falling asleep (e.g. hearing a voice calling one‚Äôs name which then startles you back to wakefulness to find no one there). The same phenomenon experienced while waking up is called hypnopompic hallucination. Frequently experienced by healthy people, and so not a symptom of mental illness.</p>
          
          <h4>Hypnopompic Hallucination</h4>
          <p>See Hypnagogic hallucination.</p>
          
          <h4>Hypochondriacal Delusion</h4>
          <p>A delusional belief that one has a serious physical illness [e.g. cancer, acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)]. Most common in psychotic depressive illnesses.</p>
          
          <h4>Hypochondriasis</h4>
          <p>The belief that one has a particular illness despite evidence to the contrary. Its form may be that of a primary delusion, an over-valued idea, a rumination, or a mood-congruent feature of depressive illness.</p>
          
          <h4>Hypomania</h4>
          <p>Describes a mild degree of mania where there is elevated mood, but no significant impairment of the patient‚Äôs day-to-day functioning.</p>

          <h4>Illusion</h4>
          <p>A type of false perception in which the perception of a real-world object is combined with internal imagery to produce a false internal percept. Three types are recognized: affect, completion, and pareidolic illusions. In affect illusion, there is a combination of heightened emotion and misperception (e.g. while walking across a lonely park at night, briefly seeing a tree moving in the wind as an attacker). Completion illusions rely on our brain‚Äôs tendency to ‚Äòfill in‚Äô presumed missing parts of an object to produce a meaningful percept and are the basis for many types of optical illusion. Both these types of illusions resolve on closer attention. Pareidolic illusions are meaningful percepts produced when experiencing a poorly defined stimulus (e.g. seeing faces in a fire or clouds).</p>

          <h4>Imperative hallucination</h4>
          <p>A form of command hallucination in which the hallucinatory instruction is experienced as irresistible, a combination of command hallucination and passivity of action.</p>
          
          <h4>Impotence</h4>
          <p>Loss of the ability to consummate sexual relationships. Refers to the inability to achieve penile erection in men and a lack of genital preparedness in women. It may have a primary medical cause, may be related to psychological factors, or can be a side effect of many psychotropic medications.</p>
          
          <h4>Incongruity of affect</h4>
          <p>Refers to the objective impression that the displayed affect is not consistent with the current thoughts or actions (e.g. laughing while discussing traumatic experiences). Occurs in schizophrenia.</p>
          
          <h4>Initial insomnia</h4>
          <p>Difficulty getting off to sleep. Seen as a symptom of primary insomnia, as well as in depressive sleep disturbance.</p>
          
          <h4>Insightlessness</h4>
          <p>See Lack of insight.</p>
          
          <h4>Irritability</h4>
          <p>Diminution in the stressor required to provoke anger or verbal or physical violence. Seen in manic illnesses, organic cognitive impairment, psychotic illnesses, and drug and alcohol intoxication. Can also be a feature of normal personality types and of personality disorder.</p>

          <p>A belief that certain actions and outcomes are connected, although there is no rational basis for establishing a connection (e.g., ‚Äòif you step on a crack, your mother will break her back‚Äô). Magical thinking is common in normal children and is the basis for most superstitions. A similar type of thinking is seen in psychotic patients.</p>
          
          <h4>Malingering</h4>
          <p>Deliberately falsifying the symptoms of illness for a secondary gain (e.g., for compensation, to avoid military service, or to obtain an opiate prescription).</p>
          
          <h4>Mania</h4>
          <p>A form of mood disorder initially characterized by elevated mood, insomnia, loss of appetite, increased libido, and grandiosity. More severe forms develop elation and grandiose delusions.</p>

          <h4>Pseudo-hallucination</h4>
          <p>A false perception which is perceived as occurring as part of one‚Äôs internal experience, not as part of the external world. It may be described as having an ‚Äòas if‚Äô quality or as being seen with the mind‚Äôs eye. Additionally, hallucinations experienced as true hallucinations during the active phase of a patient‚Äôs illness may become perceived as pseudo-hallucinations as they recover. They can occur in all modalities of sensation and are described in psychotic, organic, and drug-induced conditions, as well as occasionally in normal individuals. (The hallucinations of deceased spouses commonly described by widows and widowers may have a form of a pseudo-hallucination.)</p>
          
          <h4>Pseudologica fantastica</h4>
          <p>The production of convincing false accounts, often with apparent sincere conviction. There may be a grandiose or an over-exaggerated flavour to the accounts produced. A feature of Munchausen‚Äôs disease.</p>

          <h4>Psychomotor retardation</h4>
          <p>Spontaneous movement and slowness in instigating and completing voluntary movement. Usually associated with a subjective sense of actions being more of an effort and with subjective retardation of thought. Occurs in moderate to severe depressive illness.</p>
          
          <h4>Punding</h4>
          <p>A form of stereotyped motor behaviour in which there is an apparent fascination with repetitive mechanical tasks such as arranging items or dismantling and reassembling mechanical objects. It is seen as a side effect of anti-Parkinsonian medication and in some individuals taking methamphetamine. It bears some similarity to behaviours seen in individuals with autism.</p>
          
          <h4>Receptive dysphasia</h4>
          <p>Dysphasia affecting the understanding of speech. There is impairment in understanding spoken commands and repeating back speech. There are also significant abnormalities in spontaneous speech with word substitutions, defects in grammar and syntax, and neologisms. The abnormal speech so produced is, however, fluent (cf. expressive dysphasia), and the patient may be unconcerned by his deficits.</p>
          
          <h4>Reflex hallucination</h4>
          <p>The experience of a real stimulus in one sensory modality triggering a hallucination in another.</p>
