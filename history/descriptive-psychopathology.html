          </h2>
        </header>
        <div class='body'>
          <h4>Hypnagogic Hallucinations:</h4>
          <p>These are sensory experiences that occur as you are falling asleep. They can be visual, auditory, tactile, or olfactory. Hypnagogic hallucinations are very common, affecting up to 70% of people at some point in their lives.</p>
          
          <h4>Hypnopompic Hallucinations:</h4>
          <p>These hallucinations occur in the morning as you're waking up. They are very similar to hypnagogic hallucinations, or hallucinations that occur at night as you're falling asleep.</p>
          
          <h4>Near Death Experiences (NDEs):</h4>
          <p>A near-death experience is a profound personal experience associated with death or impending death, which researchers describe as having similar characteristics. When positive, such experiences may encompass a variety of sensations, including detachment from the body, feelings of levitation, and total serenity.</p>
          
          <h4>Pseudohallucinations:</h4>
          <p>A pseudohallucination is an involuntary sensory experience vivid enough to be regarded as a hallucination, but which is recognized by the person experiencing it as being subjective and unreal.</p>
          
          <h4>Ideas of Reference:</h4>
          <p>Ideas of reference are false beliefs that random or irrelevant occurrences in the world directly relate to oneself. When someone believes their thoughts, actions, or presence caused an event to occur, they are experiencing this cognitive distortion.</p>
          
          <h4>Panoramic Memory:</h4>
          <p>This refers to the brain's ability to merge fleeting views of our surroundings into a seamless, 360-degree panorama. Two brain regions, known as the OPA and RSC, have been identified as key to creating these panoramic memories.</p>

              <blockquote>
                <p>
                  A false, unshakeable belief which arises from internal morbid processes. It is clearly recognizable when it is out of keeping with the patient‚Äôs background‚Äô

                <p>

                <li>According to its biological purpose - e.g., theory of instinct.</li>
                <li>Feeling state is a description of all the different feelings occurring at any one time and describes the affective state of the individual at that time.</li>

          <p>‚ÄòA correct attitude to morbid change in oneself‚Äô (Lewis, 1934)</p>
          <p>Concept is multidimensional, incorporates both current and retrospective components, and is usually not an ‚Äòall-or-none‚Äô phenomenon (David, 1990)</p>
          <p>Medication compliance and awareness of illness are separate but overlapping constructs which contribute to insight (David, 1990)</p>
          
          <p>David (1990) divides insight into 3 dimensions:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>awareness of disease</li>
            <li>correct labelling of abnormality</li>
            <li>willingness to take treatment</li>
          </ol>
          
          <p>Amador et al. 1993:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>recognition of illness (signs, symptoms, etc.)</li>
            <li>attribution of illness (attribution of illness phenomena to a mental disorder)</li>
            <li>awareness of treatment</li>
            <li>awareness of social consequences of illness, e.g. disability, involuntary commitment to hospital, response/concern of relatives</li>
          </ol>
          
          <p>The questions to ask are:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Do you think that you are unwell?</li>
            <li>Do you think that you have a mental illness?</li>
            <li>Do you think that you would accept treatment?</li>
            <li>Do you feel that you need to be in hospital?</li>
          </ol>

          <h4>Hypochondriasis</h4>

          <p>A psychiatric syndrome characterized by physical symptoms disproportionate to demonstrable organic disease, fear of disease, and the conviction that one is sick, preoccupation with one‚Äôs body, and pursuit of medical care.</p>
          
          <p>Seen psychodynamically as a derivative of aggressive or oral drives, or as a defense against guilt or low self-esteem. Results from perceptual amplification and augmentation and a cognitive misinterpretation of normal body sensations. It is socially learned illness behavior to which the philosophy and practice of the medical profession lends support.</p>
          
          <p>Traid of:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Convinced that one has the disease</li>
            <li>Fearing the disease</li>
            <li>Preoccupation with the body</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>There is overlap between hypochondriasis and:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Dysmorphophobia and other body image disorders</li>
            <li>Dissatisfaction with the body may be experienced as narcissism</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>Distortion of the body image without fear of illness occurs in:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Anorexia nervosa</li>
            <li>Gross obesity</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>Somatic symptoms predominate over mood symptoms in:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>India</li>
            <li>Pakistan</li>
            <li>Bangladesh</li>
            <li>Hong Kong</li>
            <li>West Indies</li>
            <li>Parts of Africa</li>
          </ul>
          

          <p>Possible forms of the condition include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Hallucination</li>
            <li>Secondary delusion (e.g., in Cotard‚Äôs syndrome)</li>
            <li>Primary delusion</li>
            <li>Overvalued idea</li>
            <li>Obsessional rumination</li>
            <li>Depressive rumination</li>
            <li>Anxious preoccupation</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>Commonest bodily symptoms implicated are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Musculoskeletal</li>
            <li>Gastrointestinal</li>
            <li>Nervous system, e.g., headache</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>Commonest parts of the body affected are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Head and neck</li>
            <li>Abdomen</li>
            <li>Chest</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>16% have unilateral symptoms, and of these, 73% are left-sided.</p>
          

          <h4>Dysmorphophobia</h4>

          <p>Morelli, 1886</p>
          <p>Dysmorphophobia is the primary complaint of some external physical defect thought to be noticeable to other people, but objectively, their appearance lies within normal limits. The usual form is an overvalued idea.</p>
          
          <p>Characteristics:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Compared to normal controls, individuals with dysmorphophobia are often perceived as more disfigured.</li>
            <li>40% show personality disorder.</li>
            <li>There is no relationship between the degree of deformity and psychological disturbance.</li>
            <li>Often, there is a marked improvement following surgery.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>Associated with:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Anankastic or dependent personality disorder</li>
            <li>Neurotic depression</li>
            <li>Suicidal tendencies</li>
            <li>Schizophrenia</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h4>Hysteria</h4>

          <ul>
            <li>Symptoms are psychogenic.</li>
            <li>Causation is thought to be unconscious.</li>
            <li>Symptoms may carry some sort of advantage to the patient.</li>
            <li>The symptoms occur through the processes of conversion or dissociation.</li>
            <li>Conversion implies the behavior of physical illness without evidence of organic pathology; the patient is not aware of the psychogenicity.</li>
            <li>Dissociation implies a narrowing of the field of consciousness with selective amnesia. There may be dramatic but essentially superficial changes of personality, at times taking the form of a fugue (wandering state). Behavior may mimic psychosis, or rather the patient‚Äôs idea of psychosis (World Health Organization, 1977).</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h4><em>Briquet‚Äôs Syndrome</em></h4>
          
          <p>Concept formed by the St. Louis group. Most patients have severe personality disorders and show chronic hypochondriacal rather than dissociative conversion symptoms.</p>

          <h4><em>Clinical Syndromes of Hysteria</em></h4>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Ganser Syndrome:</strong> A form of hysterical pseudodementia.</li>
            <li><strong>Hysterical Pseudodementia:</strong> Characterized by symptoms resembling dementia but without organic pathology.</li>
            <li><strong>Multiple Personality:</strong> Involves the presence of two or more distinct identity states that control an individual's behavior, consciousness, and memory.</li>
            <li><strong>Epidemic, Communicated, or Mass Hysteria:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Almost always occurs in young females.</li>
                <li>Often starts with a girl of high status in her peer group who is unhappy.</li>
                <li>Tends to occur in largest numbers in children just after puberty.</li>
                <li>Appears to affect most severely those who, on subsequent testing, are found to be the most unstable.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>War Neurosis:</strong> Psychological symptoms resulting from exposure to the trauma of war.</li>
            <li><strong>Latah:</strong> A culture-bound syndrome observed primarily in Southeast Asia, characterized by exaggerated startle responses, automatic obedience, and echolalia.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h4>Psychological Pain</h4>

          <p>Psychological pain associated with psychiatric illness, according to Trethowan (1988), exhibits the following characteristics:</p>
          
          <ol>
            <li>Less well localized; diffuse; non-anatomical</li>
            <li>Constant and persists unremittingly</li>
            <li>More associated with underlying disturbance of mood</li>
            <li>Less well-described quality</li>
            <li>More likely to get worse in severity and extent with time</li>
          </ol>
          
          <h4>Artefactual Illness</h4>
          
          <p>Symptoms in artefactual illness are not real but produced under voluntary control. Symptoms are deliberate and purposeful. If there is a goal, the diagnosis is malingering rather than factitious disorder. In factitious disorder, there is no apparent goal other than assuming the sick role and cannot be considered adaptive. Examples include Munchausen syndrome and hospital addiction syndrome.</p>
          
          <h4>Anorexia Nervosa</h4>

          <ul>
            <li>Common in the UK</li>
            <li>Rare in India, Afro-Caribbean</li>
            <li>More common in people of higher social classes</li>
            <li>Those who vomit tend to overestimate their size</li>
            <li>Other groups who overestimate the size of their bodies include:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Normal females</li>
              <li>Neurotic subjects</li>
              <li>Those who are pregnant</li>
              <li>Patients with secondary amenorrhoea</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Fixed cognitive attitudes towards body shape demonstrate irrational beliefs about body size, while a fluid state of the estimation of body size depends on emotional factors that change over time</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h4>Hyperschemazia (Pathological Accentuation of Body Image)</h4>

          <ul>

          <ul>
            <li>Transection of the spinal cord</li>
            <li>Sensory deprivation (e.g., underwater)</li>
            <li>Vertigo (floating on air)</li>
            <li>Parietal lobe lesions (e.g., right middle cerebral artery thrombosis)</li>
            <li>Epileptic aura</li>
            <li>Migraine</li>
            <li>Depersonalization</li>
            <li>Anxiety</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h4>Paraschemazia (Distortion of the Body Image)</h4>

          </h2>

        <div class='body'>
          <p><strong>Obsession refers to impulses and thoughts</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Compulsions confined to motor acts</li>
            <li>Characteristics:
              <ol>
                <li>They must be recognized as the individual‚Äôs own thoughts or impulses</li>
                <li>There must be at least one thought or act that is still resisted unsuccessfully, even though others may be present which the sufferer no longer resists</li>
                <li>The thought of carrying out the act must not in itself be pleasurable (simple relief of tension or anxiety is not regarded as pleasurable)</li>
                <li>The thoughts, images, or impulses must be unpleasantly repetitive</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>According to Lewis (1936), obsessional thoughts have three essential features:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>A feeling of subjective compulsion</li>
            <li>A resistance to it</li>
            <li>Preservation of insight</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Obsessional images are always known by the patient to be his own thoughts.</p>
          <p><strong>Resistance</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>It is the resistance to the repetition of the act, not the act itself, which is the key feature.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h4>Types of obsession</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Obsessional thoughts / ideas</strong></p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <p>Repeated, intrusive thoughts interfering with normal train of thought, causing distress</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>May be single words, phrases, rhymes, or puns - often violent, obscene, or blasphemous</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Attempts to exclude them lead to distress</p>
                </li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Obsessional images</strong></p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <p>Images may be of four types:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Obsessional image - depicts repetitively the unwanted intrusive cognition</li>
                    <li>
                      Compulsive image - depicts compulsive behavior either by rectifying an obsessional image (e.g., seeing corpses in coffins and then having to imagine the same people standing) or an independent compulsive image
                    </li>
                    <li>Disaster image - compulsive checkers may also ‚Äòsee‚Äô the disaster happening if they do not turn the gas taps off, for example</li>
                    <li>Disruptive image - may intrude while compulsive rituals are being carried out and necessitate the ritual being recommenced</li>
                  </ol>
                </li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Obsessive ruminations</strong></p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <p>Endless inconclusive internal debates</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Ruminations are often pseudophilosophical, irritatingly unnecessary, repetitive and achieve no conclusion</p>
                </li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Obsessional doubts</strong></p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <p>Concern over actions, e.g., gas not switched off, doors not closed</p>
                </li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Obsessional convictions</strong></p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <p>Notions that thought equals acts, e.g., if I think about him, he will die</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>May be delusional in intensity</p>
                </li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Compulsive rituals</strong></p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <p>Mental rituals such as counting</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Physical activities like washing and checking</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>May be related to thoughts or be unconnected</p>

                <li>
                  <p>Hand washing is more common in women</p>
                </li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Obsessional slowness</strong></p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <p>Slow activity out of proportion to other symptoms</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Affects goal-directed activity - automatic activity is still carried out quickly</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>More common in men</p>
                </li>
              </ol>
            </li>
          </ol>

            <li>Obsessive-compulsive neurosis</li>
            <li>Anankastic personality disorder, especially if depressed</li>
            <li>Schizophrenia, when the obsessions are bizarre</li>
            <li>May arise de novo in the elderly associated with an organic psychosyndrome - the element of resistance is usually not present</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>Obsessive thinking:</p>

            <li>Anankasts tolerate ambiguity less readily than normals.</li>
            <li>They like to have decisions made but will delay making a decision until they have reached a greater degree of certainty than that required by other people.</li>
            <li>Thinking tends to be under-inclusive.</li>
